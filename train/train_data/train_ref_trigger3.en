He said, I 've instructed US Trade Representative Zoellick to inform European officials in September talks that the United States thinks these subsidies are unfair.
In an effort to hold high the great banner of Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought, Comrade Deng Xiaoping engaged himself in an unremitting struggle against both erroneous Left and right ideological tendencies; and when redressing the serious mistakes of the Great Cultural Revolution, he published nine important speeches in a row, thus successfully safeguarding the banner of Mao Zedong Thought and attaining a unity of thinking on the issue throughout the whole party.
However, practice proved that those ossified Left ideas did not work;
The Right opportunism line during the period following the revolution and the left opportunism line during the early 1930s could not utilize the advanced ideological theories in practice to resolve the specific problems of the revolution, and mistakes were made in the understanding of a series of major issues leading to two serious setbacks being suffered by the revolution.
Because there exist in our society the trends of thought from the right and the left that doubt and negate Marxism, we should more firmly and conscientiously safeguard the guiding position of Marxism in the ideological field.
Bush said, I 've told Zoellick that he should leave no stones unturned to eliminate these subsidies, including an appeal to the World Trade Organization if needed.
At the time when the line of leftism prevailed, the ideas that socialism meant poor and capitalism was equal to prosperity was instilled into people's minds, thus distorting the essence of socialism.
During the 10-year calamity, our country suffered from leftist disruptions and deviated from the fundamental task of developing social productive forces; as a result, the national economy almost came to the brink of collapse and the Chinese nation lost a valuable development opportunity.
When studying this conclusion made by the 15th party congress, I feel that only by making a repeated comparison of various Left and right theories concerning the fate of socialism can we gain a profound understanding of this issue.
Zoellick said there is a tremendous opportunity to see some very substantial reform in the international agricultural system.
US Trade Representative Zoellick said he sees a chance for agreement on cutting agricultural subsidies and opening markets in current World Trade Organization talks, clearing the way for a global deal on freer trade.

On Premier Zhou Enlai's instructions, he also redressed the Left practices of the gang of four in diplomatic exchanges and energetically restored and expanded our party's international exchanges.
This is the reason why there are trends of thought doubting and negating Marxism from the right and the left .
Objectively speaking, the Left policies we carried out during the Great Cultural Revolution, for example, made it impossible for to us give a good play to the advantages of socialism, and they did hurt some people's feelings towards socialism.
At the time, Comrade Geng Biao was China's ambassador to Burma.As soon as he stepped down from the airplane, he was immediately criticized and repudiated by people with leftist ideology.

In the course of doing ideological and political work, we should pay attention to the handling of the relationship between economic development and ideological-political work, and prevent the comeback of the leftist things which have been long discarded.
The erroneous trend of thought from the left mainly finds expression in the doubt on the party's line, principles, and policies since the 3d plenary session of the 11th CPC Central Committee.
As a result of the investigation and exchange, the Xiaozheng People's Commune overcame the interference from the left and adhered to its orientation in pig breeding.

In its history, our party has been able to smash the fetters of formalism and empiricism, redress the errors of Left and right opportunism, restore and carry forward the fine work style of seeking truth from facts, and bring about a smooth progress to the undertakings of revolution and construction. The credit to all this should, in the final analysis, also go to the philosophy of Marxism.
Deng Xiaoping said: Taking reform and opening-up as introducing and developing capitalism, holding that the danger of peaceful evolution mainly comes from the economic field are actually ' leftist ' ideas Since the 15th CPC National Congress, the left viewpoints were less obvious, but this does not mean that such viewpoints have disappeared. Some people now still argue that socialism with Chinese characteristics we are pursuing is actually capitalism with Chinese characteristics.
Academic rights and wrongs should be differentiated from political rights and wrongs. For academic issues, it is necessary to continue to carry out the principle of allowing a-hundred schools of thought to contend . As for erroneous political viewpoints that may disrupt the overall situation, no matter whether they come from the right or the left , we must explicitly and unambiguously criticize them with a clear-cut attitude without any hesitation.
Historical practice has proved that in our efforts to build up socialism, both Left and right deviations will not do; and the only correct way for us is to organically integrate the basic theories of Marxism with the realistic conditions of our country and with the special features of time, and build up socialism with the special characteristics of our own country.
Faced with the erroneous effects of the Left after the conclusion of the Cultural Revolution , he successively published such famous articles as Work According to Economic Law, Speed Up the Realization of Four Modernizations and On Some Phrasing Questions of Class Struggle During the Socialist Period , thereby creating public opinion for emancipating the mind and bringing order out of chaos.
In the face of this vicious wave, he and Comrade Huang Zhen wrote a big-character poster, co-signed by 26 veteran ambassadors, to angrily denounce the leftist ideology and attack Wang Li, once all-powerful member of the center of the Great Cultural Revolution .

To evaluate their performance and service effectiveness, the ITs, to which additional resources will be allocated, will be required to submit statistical returns on both output and outcome indicators. These will include the number of YNDs contacted and served, the number of referrals made to existing welfare service operators, the percentage of YNDs who continue to receive mainstream services after a period of time and the percentage of YNDs who after receiving service continue in education or employment.

We hope that the Taiwan authorities will return to the one China principle as soon as possible; refrain from creating new trouble in cross-strait relations; and take concrete steps to realize direct cross-strait transport links at an early date.
The survey also discovered that the voices that support direct exchanges of air and shipping services between the two sides of the strait were louder than before. Under the circumstance where no precondition or limit was set, 61 percent of the populace agreed to open direct exchanges of air and shipping services between the two sides of the strait. This was the highest proportion compared to the successive surveys conducted by this newspaper, and it was 8 percentage points more than that in October last year.
Article 22. Any construction of pipelines and auxiliary facilities that traverse a river course, a river dam, and a waterway, and any construction of pipeline protection works built in the middle of a river course, shall comply with both the flood control standards and the navigation standards of the state.
He said: Since 1979, we have always been devoted to the realization of direct transportation, trade, and postal service between the two sides of the Taiwan Strait.
The reporter has learned from the national navigation work conference, recently held in Nanjing, that radar navigation for incoming and outgoing vessels has been introduced in the waters of all of China's 16 key coastal ports, including Tianjin Harbor, Shanghai Harbor, and Beilun Harbor.
As the two sides of the Strait are parts of one China, cross-strait links naturally are internal routes of one country.
This is in fact no different from Lee Teng-hui's theory on special state-to state relations.  It is a reprint of the two-state theory aimed at creating two Chinas,  one China, one Taiwan and erecting new obstacles to direct cross-strait transport links.
In recent years, with the joint efforts made by compatriots on both sides of the strait, cross-strait economic exchanges and cooperation have become close and closer. The annual volume of trade between the two sides has exceeded $20-billion. Every year, there is over 10-million tons of cargoes to be transported. Realizing direct links in trade, transportation, and postal services across the Taiwan Strait has become an urgent need in the further development of cross-strait economic and trade relations.
In civil aviation there are 56 air lines, seven of which are international ones connecting Xinjiang to various provincial capitals in the country and to surrounding countries. Airports are being built at Altai, Qiemo, and Kuqa, the construction of Hotan Airport will be started soon, and some old airports are being rebuilt or upgraded.
The normalization of cross-strait relations must begin from the normalization of the economy and trade. Hence, the three links (transport, postal, and trade) issue can not be avoided.
We hold that direct cross-strait links should adhere to the principle of one China, two-way direct links, and mutual benefit and be managed in accordance with special measures for internal affairs.
The trial methods for transport links between Jinmen and Mazu and the mainland announced by Taiwan restrict people and goods from both sides of the strait from transhipping via Jinmen and Mazu, and impose certain unreasonable restrictions on mainland people and goods entering Jinmen and Mazu.This shows that the Taiwan authorities have no sincerity and goodwill regarding the improvement of cross-strait ties.
On New Year's Day 1979 the National People's Congress Standing Committee advocated that the two sides of the strait establish postal, transport, and economic and trade exchanges as soon as possible to bring closer the cross-strait economic ties.
Despite the ups and downs in the situation across the Taiwan Straits over the past five years, the compatriots at home and abroad, inspired and propelled by President Jiang's speech, made common efforts to boost cross-strait relationship through a tortuous course. Seen from the contacts and exchanges between Macao and Taiwan, since the opening of navigation between Macao and Taiwan in December 1995, the number off Taiwan compatriots coming to Macao had increased from 244, 000 in 1994 to over 900, 000 in 1999, a 2.75-fold increase.
It should be pointed out that the sea links opened up by the Taiwan authorities between Jinmen and Mazu and Fuzhou and Xiamen are not three links of true significance and can not resolve the present requirements of large interflow of people and economic and trade exchanges.
Within the scope of a safety protection zone specified above, except for dredging works conducted for the purposes of fighting floods and opening up navigation under the precondition of ensuring the safety of pipelines and auxiliary facilities, no one is allowed to drop anchor, drag anchor, fetch sand, dig out sludge, blast fish, conduct underwater explosions, or engage himself in any other underwater activities that may endanger the safety of pipelines and auxiliary facilities.
Their regulations on cross-strait relations set all kinds of restrictions on direct cross-strait transport and business and do not permit direct three links, and if such things are discovered they are treated as crimes and punished.
However, owing to factors on the Taiwan side, the two shores of the straits have failed to introduce direct shipping with each other to date and quite a few Taiwan-based Matsu followers have had to come by a roundabout route, and this is neither convenient nor safe.
We should conscientiously implement the two adjustments policy, speed up the relocation project, strengthen the structural adjustment of the factories and enterprises that have been relocated out of the Three Gorges area, make every effort to ensure the fulfillment of relocation, and try every possible means to guarantee that water storage, electricity generation, and shipping will start as planned under the Three Gorges project.
Since direct voyage between the two sides of the strait has not yet been realized, believers can only come by a roundabout route. They have to spend lots of time, energy and money during the trip.
Zhang Jie, director of the navigation department of the center, said that they have adjusted the major search area according to the direction of the sea current. Deyao and Huijiu 202 ships already have left waters near Xisha Island and arrived at the new search area on 12 April.
At the second stage, Taiwan will coordinate with the relevant economic security mechanism and the effective establishment of an emergency mechanism; carry out direct two-way commodity, capital, and personnel exchanges; and work out overall planning for cross-strait air and shipping transportation, which will be implemented through consultations between the two sides.
As a result, the cross-strait economic ties have undergone a constant expansion both in range and scale, the number of people involved in cross-strait personnel exchanges is going up by the year, limited headway has been achieved in the direct exchange of postal and shipping services, and Taiwan compatriots have showed a stronger demand for an early realization of three direct exchanges across the strait.
The MAC emphasized: After reviewing the specifics of the policy on the three mini links, it is initially decided that the restriction of one area and one port will be relaxed conditionally on the premise that security and effective management are considered, and passenger transport facilities will be completed first and passenger service center planned for Kinmen's Shuitou Port before opening the port for passenger transport service.
On this basis and following the example of the Hong Kong-Taiwan transportation service, we may establish a cross-strait direct transportation link without holding talks.
On shipping: The mode of cargo first and people later will initially be adopted. Cargo transportation will be opened up. Air and marine shipping will proceed at the same time.

The Chinese Government has been consistent from beginning to end in upholding the one-China principle and resolutely opposing any attempts to separate Taiwan from China.
However, the danger of the separatist forces in Taiwan attempting to separate Taiwan de jure from the motherland still exists.

We will have full determination, confidence, capability, and ways to safeguard the country's sovereignty and territorial integrity and will never allow an inch of land to be separated from the territory of the motherland.
If any grave incident of separating Taiwan from China under any pretexts takes place, if any foreign force occupies Taiwan, and if the Taiwan authorities indefinitely refuse to peacefully resolve the issue of cross-strait reunification through negotiations, we will apply all means to resolutely smash any attempt to split up China and to realize the complete reunification of the motherland.
If a crucial incident occurs that would separate Taiwan from China on any pretext, if there is a foreign invasion of Taiwan, or if the Taiwan authorities indefinitely refuse to peacefully solve the cross-strait problem through negotiations, the Chinese Government will be forced to take all possible drastic steps to defend China's sovereignty and territorial integrity.
This is the determining factor, so that even though there are bound to be barriers and obstructions along the road to national unification, any and all attempts to separate Taiwan from China will surely fail.
However, if any major incidents of separating Taiwan from China under whatever names happen in Taiwan, if foreign countries invade and occupy Taiwan, and if the Taiwan authorities indefinitely rejects peacefully resolving the issue of cross-strait reunification through negotiations, the Chinese Government can only be forced to adopt every possible decisive measure, including use of force, to safeguard China's sovereignty and territorial integrity and complete the great reunification cause of China.
If a major incident occurs in which Taiwan is separated from China in any name, if Taiwan is invaded and occupied by foreign forces, if the Taiwan authorities refuse indefinitely to peacefully solve the question of reunifying the two sides of the Taiwan Strait through negotiations, the Chinese government will have to take all possible drastic measures under compelled circumstances to safeguard China's sovereignty and territorial integrity.

But, in the event that any serious incidents to split Taiwan from China under any pretext occur, that a foreign country invades Taiwan, or that the Taiwan authorities refuse for an indefinite time to settle the issue of cross-strait peaceful reunification through talks, then we will be forced to take all possible drastic measures to accomplish the great cause of the motherland's reunification.

If any grave turn occurs in Taiwan leading to the separation of Taiwan from China in any name, if Taiwan is invaded and occupied by a foreign country, and if the Taiwan authorities refuse, sine die, the peaceful settlement of cross-strait reunification through negotiation, it will then be impossible to have peaceful reunification and the Chinese Government will only be forced to adopt necessary measures to smash the separatist scheme for Taiwan independence and safeguard China's sovereignty and territorial integrity.

The meeting has thus played a role in promoting peaceful reunification.
Second, at present it is the Democratic Progress Party which regards Taiwan independence as its aim of pursuit that is in power. And since the DPP took charge of Taiwan, it has put ideology in command, which results in the political situation being turbulent, the economy sliding downward, society being out of order, and the people feeling uneasy.
Kantor also said that with economic globalization, investors should also show their concerns about the appeals made by relevant persons regarding such issues as unemployment as well as environmental and ecological protection.

Having contacts, dialogs and negotiations between the two sides of the strait at an earlier date under the principle of one China has become the increasingly popular call of people in Taiwan and the political demand of many parties, factions, groups and people.
The leader of Taiwan should be able to see, from Lee's political impasse, that there is no future for Taiwan independence, and that he should change his course, accept the one-China principle as quickly as possible, and sincerely hold talks with the mainland, in accordance with the Taiwan people's call for a relaxation in cross-strait relations, stability, and prosperity.
If all peaceful methods have been exhausted and Taiwan still refuses to recognize one China, if it only engages in empty talks about peace rather than seeking reunification, then Communist China will not rule out resorting to use force to achieve cross-strait reunification.
Once he has made a promise, he must take action to fulfill it. Otherwise, he will not be able to fulfill our Taiwan compatriots ' wishes disfavoring Taiwan independence and the tense and turbulent cross-strait situation.
The eight-point proposal primarily calls for the realization of cross-strait political negotiations.
China's concern is not without reason. Following the restrictions on the import of the three kinds of Chinese farm products, trade associations in Japan, including towel, necktie, hosiery, and bicycle manufacturers as well as the eel-fishing industry, have vied to file requests for similar restrictions.
For this reason, after the DPP takes power, it will continue to use cooperation with the US on the one hand, strengthening future US influence on Taiwan's future, while on the other hand never lightly abandoning the demand for Taiwanese independence and thus losing its ability to bargain with the US, pressuring the US to adjust its one China policy, and provide the standard weight of a protective alliance.
He advised Beijing to change its practice of putting pressure on Taiwan or even threating Taiwan.Instead, Beijing should make an appeal to Taiwan. Beijing should explain to Taiwan the benefit of closer relations instead of telling Taiwan the danger of distant relations , he said.
According to some members of the solidarity union, in his speech, Li Teng-hui encouraged those entering the election to call for the building of local culture. He told them to go ahead steadily and strike sure blows in the election. At the final critical moment of the election, he will appear to enlist support for candidates from the solidarity union and consolidate supporters ' confidence.
Hiatt beautifies the United States as a gentleman of morality and justice.  This is as stupid as plugging one's ears while stealing a bell. Who does not know that the United States has always regarded Taiwan as an unsinkable aircraft carrier ?
In order to gain votes by swindling and lightening the color of Taiwan independence, Chen Shui-bian proposed a so-called new middle line during the election campaign. His purpose is to stay clear of the main points and strike at the minor ones, and change the DPP's pursuit of establishing the Republic of Taiwan to establishing the Republic of Taiwan in the name of the Republic of China.
In the face of the strong momentum of calls inside and outside Taiwan for the three links, the election candidates profoundly realize that the three links are a major issue and an entrance ticket in the election battle, and they can only win people's favor by acceding to their wishes.

The lesson from its Vietnam War defeat has made the United States more cautious and conservative in using military forces overseas; what's more, it would be up against the Chinese Communists, rather than some trivial small countries, in a Taiwan Strait war.
In fact, $6 million is only a trifling small amount in relation to the losses to Hong Kong's economy, society, and people's lives created by the Democratic Party's long period of opposition to China and wreaking havoc in Hong Kong.
Nonetheless, the question is: Are the Chinese communists willing to give in on such a principled issue as sovereignty for the sake of nothing but a meager profit generated by the air route?
The festival will feature a wide variety of cultural and entertainment programmes from today until December 13.
The Central and Western District mirrors Hong Kong's prosperity and the major infrastructure projects planned for the district will not only pave the road for greater future economic development but help attract more tourists to Hong Kong, the Director of Home Affairs, Mrs Shelley Lau, said today (Sunday) .
In fact, the festival expenditure is expected to exceed $2 million, of which $690, 000 will be funded by the Central and Western Provisional District Board and $136, 000 by the Provisional Urban Council, with the rest covered by local donations, Mrs Lau said.
As well, judging according to a normal situation - which is not speaking of the objective factor that China's territory is too big and Taiwan is only a trifling province - if the two sides simultaneously continue to follow the present speed of development, I 'm afraid that in another 50 years it will still be difficult for China's economy to be on the same level as Taiwan's.
She noted that the festival has adopted the slogan of Hong Kong Our Home and that it enjoyed the enthusiastic support of many local business and community groups.
The show is jointly organised by Chung Wan and Sheung Wan Area Committee, the 6th Central and Western District Festival Organising Committee, the Council of Central and Western District School Heads, the Central and Western District Association for Culture and Arts, the Rotary Club of Hong Kong Bayview, and the Central and Western District Office.

those making them believe that Falungong in Hong Kong has only few hundred people, its influence is limited, and in truth it has not violated the law.

In his toast speech, ambassador Longbin Tang reviewed the stably developing political and economic situations in China last year, and extended gratitude to the overseas Chinese and foreign citizens of Chinese origin for their warm support for China's construction undertaking, and for contributions made to developing friendship between the people of the two countries of China and Sweden.
Besides, Qian Qichen also met with US journalist circles, industrial and commercial circles, congressmen, organizations of Chinese and American Chinese and made important speeches on several occasions.
The association plans to first unite with New York's Chinese Americans, and then unite with other Chinese Americans from all locations across the United States, and to develop struggle against Falungong.
Following the disappearance in the mainland of a number of Chinese scholars and persons from Hong Kong, information from a news web site reports that Liang Hua, owner of a Hong Kong book store was arrested by Public Security in Shenzhen on suspicion of gathering intelligence for Taiwan.

The declaration urged public opinion to look squarely at the calamity and misfortune that the behavior and conduct of Falungong adherents brings to Chinese communities and the next generation of Chinese Americans, and reminded parents busy with jobs and earning a living to pay attention to persons with whom their children make friends, in order to prevent their being taken in and deceived.
Regarding the US State Department's warning on visits to the Chinese mainland by US citizens of Chinese origin, Zhang Yuanyuan said incomprehensible because now is China's tourist season and large numbers of American tourists are visiting China.Even reporters are organizing groups to visit the Chinese mainland next month, he said.

No doubt, the EP-3 aircraft collision incident happened at a sensitive moment for US-China relations. In the next couple of weeks, President Bush has to make a decision on US arms sales (including Aegis destroyers) to Taiwan, which the Chinese communists spare no effort to oppose. The Chinese communists recently detained Gao Zhan, a mainland scholar living in the United States, and Professor Li Shaoming, an American of Chinese origin, one after another.
It can be said that Premier Zhu has showed sincere feelings, as well as extreme patience and magnanimity, in his remarks, and has spoken the mind of the compatriots on both sides of the Taiwan Straits, as well as the mind of all the people of the Chinese origin and overseas Chinese in the world. We hope that the Taiwan compatriots can pay close attention to the importance of his remarks.

What will be the result?
However, these were merely two high-level contacts that started well but did not end well.
Anybody attempting to take advantage of the stepping down of the Kuomintang to pursue Taiwan independence is unlikely to succeed and is doomed to fail.
White House spokesman Fitzwater said that the US government considers this really is a tragic outcome .
We worry that the continuing stalemate will certainly lead to a lose-lose situation.
However, who should bear the responsibility for the incident? The detailed reasons, process of handling the incident, and final outcome are important issues the world is concerned about.
These are the ill consequences of what Lee Teng-hui had done which have brought about his ouster.
Information warfare has become the key tool that is launched ahead of other combat operations and runs throughout the entire course of combat that impacts the proceedings and conclusion of the combat.
A local war fought under the high-tech condition mostly has the nature of a decisive battle. Therefore, a strategic decision has significant influence on the outcome of a war.
And the people are anxiously waiting for the outcome of this election.
The embarrassing end ofthe Yinhe incident was that the US personnel saw with their own eyes thatthere was really no chemical weapons on the freighter.
As pilots who are the main players in aerial battles, we will have important responsibilities to bear in future aerial warfare. The results of the battles will have a direct impact on the victory of the operations, and may even on the situation of the war as a whole.
Under modern conditions, especially under high-tech conditions, firepower warfare has been vigorously developing to an unprecedented high level. Firepower has become more extensive, more powerful, and more omnipresent. It can even be said that the progress and ending of a battle with firepower will decide the progress and ending of a war.
The repeated defeats and futile attempts have not made the United States mend its ways, because the United States doggedly clings to its Cold War mentality and stubbornly pursues its anti-China policy.
People are not surprised by the ouster of Lee Teng-hui - - it was the result of his playing all kinds of political tricks and completely loosing the support of the people, and an inevitable consequence of his adherence to a splittist line, which has made him the general representative of Taiwan's splittist forces and the underminer of stability in the Taiwan Strait.
Under modern conditions, especially under the conditions of high technologies, fighting with firepower has been vigorously developing to an unprecedented high level. Firepower has become more extensive, more powerful, and more omnipresent. It can even be said that the progress and ending of a battle with firepower will decide the progress and ending of a war.
The way out is returning to the one-China principle and realizing the principle of peaceful reunification and one country, two systems. Only thus can there be an outcome with the lowest cost, the most dependable result, and the best effect, which benefits all sides.
By wantonly engaging in pragmatic diplomacy and money diplomacy, the Taiwan authorities not only fail to earn recognition from the international community but actually find themselves in a worsening situation.
Lee Teng-hui's downfall is the inevitable result of his persistence in the splittist line and his damaging the cross-strait relations.
and the combat effectiveness of an army in conducting combined operations has a direct bearing on both the process and the outcome of a war.
Over the past decades, Taiwan authorities have been energetically pursuing pragmatic diplomacy and dollar diplomacy , but still can not win the recognition of the international community; on the contrary, the ending is getting more and more miserable.
This consequence will hurt both sides and the key issue is who will be able to bear the burden of loss.
AFP holds that if the two sides do not find any settlement in thenext few days, the ultimate end to the Sino-US standoff is that bilateralrelations will most likely be undermined because of the plane collisionincident.
In short, the most reasonable conclusion of this accident is to urge the United States to make an apology and compensation.
The main players in the meeting, Palestinian National Authority Chairman ' Arafat and Israeli Premier Baraq, remained tight-lipped about the conclusion of the meeting and only had a word to two to say.
As is well known, the Falungong cult has been outlawed in China in accordance with the law. However, international anti-China forces take it as a tool for attacking China.It is not at all surprising that the evil forces helping the evil cult ended up in failure.
Sinking into the mire deeper and deeper, they were finally devoid of all senses and lost self-control. It is true that Li Hongzhi and his like are cunning and their fallacies are quite deceitful, but the tragic end of some Falungong infatuates could not be separated from their ignorance and a lack of a correct world outlook and a correct outlook on life.
On the issue of arms sales to Taiwan, now we may probably see such a conclusion: The arms sales are not satisfied by both sides on the strait but are acceptable by both.
They devotedly staged self-immolation for the founder but in the end he has abandoned them.

Members noted, however, the dangers both of injecting liquidity too quickly into the system when the Aggregate Balance dipped below zero, which could give rise to perceptions that the HKMA was seeking to suppress the working of the interest rate adjustment mechanism and reduce the incentive for banks to obtain Hong Kong dollars on their own initiative, and of acting too slowly, which could lead to unnecessarily large fluctuations in the exchange rate and interest rates.
Although the United States calls ethnic Chinese a model ethnic minority, quite a number of whites still look down on ethnic Chinese in their heart of hearts. Faced with the outstanding achievements of ethnic Chinese in the academic, science and technological, and industrial and commercial fields, they have suffered from a psychological unbalance, and the subconscious attitude of repressing and discriminating against ethnic Chinese has been waiting for the right time to break out.

A leader of the army group told me: The latest edition of The Program has summed up the successful experiences generated by various units in training their officers and men through science and technology over the past few years, and it will help popularize and push forward in an all-round way the good practice of training officers and men through science and technology.
The state's functional organ for national defense education should step up its effort to formulate a general program for all-people national defense education and relevant rules, give more effective guidance to the routine work of different types, and in particular, do a good job in organizing the activities of the first All-People National Defense Education Day.
The outline regulations for armed swimming crossing stipulate a distance of 500 meters, but they swim 3, 000 meters, and the record for the whole company is 58 minutes!
It is proper to compile relatively stable education programs and materials on basic theory on the basis of having different levels, targets, and contents; it is also proper to have promotion examinations.
After the PLA units charged with the task of conducting trial training at all levels wind up their the second round of trial training in accordance with the latest edition of The Program, all the PLA units are expected to launch centralized training in accordance with the latest edition of The Program with an eye on unifying understanding among various units and teaching various units the new training methods.
After summing up and sorting out the experiences generated by the PLA units at all levels in training officers and men through science and technology over the past three years, the PLA general departments have preliminarily completed the latest edition of The Program of Military Training and Examination, which lays stress on a reform of training content.
and a carefully written new Taiwan independence plan of action, mild and good-natured on the surface but actually overbearing.
With the latest loose-leaf edition of The Program, the PLA units are able to discard outdated training contents and introduce new ones in light of military development at any time, and this enables them to constantly update and develop their military training;
Japan's Outline of Defense Program, which was revised in 1995, states: In accordance with such a principle as raising efficiency and streamlining backbone forces, Japan's Ground Self-Defense Force shall establish six brigades by stages and in groups by reducing the 5th Division and the 11th Division, which are stationed in Hokkaido, and the 13th Division, which is stationed in Honshu, into a mobile ground brigade;

Everyone with a little knowledge of world history knows that the assassination of the archduke of the Austrian-Hungarian Empire in Sarajevo in 1914 directly caused the outbreak of a war which no one wanted to see.
Britain and the Qing Empire, the two imperialist powers, decided from the outside that Tibet was to be ruled by the Han people.
As to the reasons for US withdrawal from the Balkans, Hulsman said that Bush is concerned about imperial overstretch.
We are not pursuing the heritage of empire.
To begin with, the treaties and agreements in question were just concluded between several hegemonic imperialists, and their appropriateness was open to question.
Nevertheless, Britain is, after all, no longer an Empire on which the sun never set; therefore, its long-practiced foreign policy of following the United States is unlikely to change, and it is unimaginable that the Labor administration will ultimately change Britain's special relations with the United States because of the missile defense issue.
As former UN Secretary General Butros-Ghali said, if everyone wears the same clothes, speaks the same language, and has the same customs, we will be facing the danger of a kind of global fascist empire.
What is even more serious, during US election campaigns in recent years, some politicians make a point of using China as a target of attack, saying that China is an evil empire.  They also have willfully vilified the Chinese people and the policy of the Chinese Government.This has aroused the indignation of the Chinese people.
One of the superficial characteristics of the new Hegemonism is that the Pentagon exerts its utmost strength to look for a new evil empire.
Around the time of World War II, when the old empires of Britain and Germany were very keen on huge battleships with big guns, the United States and Japan were vigorously developing aircraft carriers, and the Battle of the Coral Sea was the opener to carrier warfare.
The facts of history are such that, more often than not, the central government's control of Tibet has not at all been through imperialist hegemony and military invasion . Rather, it was Tibet's governors of the Tibetan nationality who took the initiative to work together with the high-level rulers of the Han in the interior and the other minorities, in order to jointly rule over every nationality under them.
In 1907, imperial Britain and Russia signed a treaty in St Petersburg and agreed that they should discuss with the Chinese government on matters regarding Tibet.
The work can be roughly divided into two parts. The first two chapters are the first part, in which the author starts with the US bombing of the Chinese Embassy in Yugoslavia, to expose the dual US policy on China relations and the essence of the United States of America.
Opening the books of history, we can see that from the marriage of the Tang Princess Wencheng to Tibet to the occupation of Tibet by the Qing court in 1720, Chinese rule over Tibet has always been based on imperialist hegemony and armed invasion.
History has often been woven out of arrogance and unquenchable thirst for power. If empires had known when and where to stop, and if emperors had strictly observed the doctrine of the mean, history books would have been much thinner.
He also believes that China's administration and control of Tibet throughout history has been based on imperialist hegemony and military invasion , and that the good treatment of the Tibetan people by the Central People's Government is simply their own assertions .
In the area of new high level technology, the investment projects of world famous multinational companies such as the US's Eton, Germany's Deutsch, the UK's Imperial Chemicals, etc.all have first-class international levels of technology. These projects powerfully bring about optimization and improvement of Shandong Province's industrial structure.
After such multi-national companies as Dupont, HP, Siemens, Panasonic, Daewoo, etc.successively invested in Shandong, ten multinational companies such as America's Chevron and Eton, France's Elf, Shenggeban and the French Electric Company, Germany's Deutsch, UK's Imperial Chemicals, etc.have come to invest in Shandong for the first time.
This being the case, the United States has exhumed the Cold War corpse from the deserted graveyard, and relegated some countries they grouped together to the category of evil empires.  By doing this, the United States can reinstate its status as the protective umbrella with which it can incorporate the European Union and Japan into its safety valve.
KBE means (secondary) high-ranking knight of the United Kingdom.
At the Imperial Hotel where he stayed, Lee Teng-hui's request to fly the blue sky and white sun flag was refused by the hotel management.
Second, since communist China has limited strength, it has no intention of building a communist empire, or constantly turning other countries into communist countries. In addition, while communist China is promoting reforms and opening up, it has to pay attention to ways of utilizing national resources. It is very difficult for communist China to play by the line of wanting nuclear strength above anything else as in the 1960s.
Shortly after the end of the Cold War, Clinton, in order to avoid following the law governing the decline of empires in history, aimed the economy like a laser beam in making policy decisions of his administration. He placed the economic agenda ahead of military security, democracy, and the human rights; actively explored the Asia-Pacific market and information industry;
Then, in the glare of publicity, he drove to the Imperial Hotel with escort by a Japanese police motorcade and plainclothesmen. When he arrived in the hotel, Taiwan's representative and Taiwan independence advocates in Japan were there to greet him. Lee Teng-hui walked briskly and waved to the well-wishers in acknowledgment, showing absolutely no sign that he was critically ill as he claimed.
One wants to be a contemporary overlord, while the other is unwilling to have the sun set on its empire.
Lingle, in his article, believes that because treaties and agreements throughout Tibet's history were concluded by several hegemonistic empires , therefore, simply does not hold water , no matter whether it is considered from the standpoint of history or reason.
Lee Teng-hui, who claimed he was critical ill because of his heart conditions and must go to Japan to receive medical treatment, arrived in Kansai Airport alive and kicking shortly after 1800 Japan time by Japan's Asian Airlines.Wearing a broad smile on his face, he checked into Osaka's Imperial Hotel at about 1930.
On the other hand, who Annette Lu and her like really want to collude with are the scum of our nation who betray China to seek wealth and fame and those foreign imperialists who attempt to use Taiwan to constrain China.Annette Lu and her like think that, as long as they can win these foreign imperialists ' support for the survival of Taiwan independence forces, they will be more than willing to serve foot washing water to these foreigners.
He said: No, this is not the crusaders ' march to the East or a holy war. This is thoroughly a war of looting and a ruthless and violent act.  (Bebel's speech at the German Imperial Parliament; page 35 of volume 1 of the Report on the 1900-1902 Annual Meeting of the German Imperial Parliament )

The number eighth expression plan stated in the process of both sides of the strait striving to seek the state's reunification, both sides adhere to the one-China principle although they held different views on the meaning of and understanding of one-China.
Second, the Taiwan government must act according to the eighth proposal, which SEF submitted in those years, and they must repeatedly express the basic attitude of, both sides of the straits insist on a one-China policy, and make a joint effort to achieve national reunification.
The fall of the eighth domino comes when the PRC respects the wishes of the vast majority of Chinese people both in China and abroad, on behalf of the highest Chinese values and ideals, and to implement strategic benefits, for the benefit of the Chinese nationality, and for the benefit of the nation, makes a thorough resolution to the question.

Besides, Indian Prime Minister Vajpayee also found a place in the top ten of the list, but he was at number ten, below cricket player Tendulkar, who secured the number eight position.
If it was, why was the statement issued in the name of Eighth United States Army Commander Petrosky rather than by USFK Commander Thomas Schwartz and announced by the USFK's bulletin office?

The former has pointed out in explicit terms that the West poses a potential threat to the security of Russia, and has lifted restrictions on the use of nuclear weapons to a considerable extent;
To some extent, the later difficulties are more severe than the earlier ones.
The reason why these news items are shocking is because as soon as the former comes into being it is bound to deal a mortal blow at international nuclear disarmament efforts, while the latter may affect changes in combat methods in the new century.
A comparison of the two shows clearly that the latter is a fundamental condition, which serves as the foundation and precondition of the former.
Very obviously it is the latter and not the former.
The key problem lies in the former lacking effective telecommunications and GPS equipment.
The former will criticize the latter for missing an opportunity, while the latter will criticize the former for being impractical. Such a debate greatly transcends any debate in ideology or beliefs, and represents an operational dilemma of more general significance.
The former involves all aspects related to armed forces buildup and future war. This is something that has a bearing on the overall situation and reflects the universal law governing war and the generality of war;
With regard to the former, Sun Jiazheng said they will add an auspicious, peaceful atmosphere to the UN grand ceremony for the millennium and display the Chinese people's tradition of cherishing peace and respecting culture.

If the former is said to be representative of the essence of national art, then the colorfulness of folk art is what the latter will be showing.
Even though Taiwan must attain US military assistance to ensure military balance on both sides of the strait, the United States has its policy limitations while Taiwan also has certain borderlines.  After all, US-Taiwan military ties are not an alliance and Taiwan can not possibly always rely on US military defense to ensure its national security.
The former is founded on the source of practice and testing.
Further, if the former is increased twice as much, then the latter will be 27 times as much.
Faced with the first question, the two countries stand in sharp opposition to each other.
In this sense, the subject of peacetime and wartime strategic studies is basically one and the same - - namely, war - - with potential war serving as the subject of peacetime studies and real war in wartime studies.

The vulture and the angel belong to different species.

Li Hongzhi achieved the crazy damage done by the latter as a result of the mental benumbing of the former.
With regard to the former, the two countries are going tit for tat;

After all, the labor-intensive industry offers more jobs for the people.
The former, which can land on waters even when the wind speed is 25 meters [per second] and the waves are three meters high, is placed under the command of the No.
