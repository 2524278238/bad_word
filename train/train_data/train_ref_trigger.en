Although Taiwan has plenty of rice,it depends to a serious degree on exports for miscellaneous grain such as wheat,maize,and soybeans,and at present it imports about 10 million tons of these a year. 
(AFP report from Rome)Sixty-one governmental officials will meet next week in Bangkok to discuss the tendency of the world 's rice production decline that is increasingly becoming a concern. 
The stagnation of production in many Asian countries,the restrictions on expansion of arable land and the lack of water resources for the expansion of rice-growing lands are the major factors preventing the growth of rice 's production, Chen Da pointed out.
Thus the farmers became much more interested in growing rice,and the acreage of rice production increased markedly. 
Rice expert Chen Da from the Rome-based UN Food and Agricultural Organization(FAO)said : The growth rate of the rice production is now increasingly slowing.
The nominal protection rate of China 's grains(processed rice and wheat),as was the case in the mid-1990s,was zero,and the anticipated nominal protection rate of China 's grains after China 's accession to WTO will also be zero. 
In the meantime,the news that the production of wheat,rice,corn,and other agricultural products has picked up also got around the grain wholesale markets,and the grain prices that had been falling for 50 months in a row began to show signs of firmness. 
Their actual protection rates,after taking into account the relative protection degree of input articles,are negative at the moment. In the future,rice processing will still be negative although the degree of negative protection will decrease slightly. Wheat protection will be zero. 
For this reason,in its asking price for China 's accession to the WTO,the international community has no objection to China 's current practice of erecting a 100-percent nontariff barrier to rice and wheat,allowing it to retain all of them. 
UN FAO contributed the decline partly to the lack of research and development investment on the irrigation facilities and the rice research work over the past few years.

After ascending to office,the new United States President Bush impatiently directed the United States Department of Defense to reevaluate the global stationing of its military forces,especially those forces stationed in Japan,with the desire to further strengthen US-Japanese alliance. 
Although the US military has to this day not announced any new breakthroughs in the research of missile interception,Bush,who has been in power for barely more than 100 days,has already started in haste to go all out to push a missile defense system. It is crystal clear that this is a political decision for honoring the checks he issued while running for the presidency,and also for satisfying his supporters ' strong appeals.
Japanese Defense Agency Director Kazuo Torashima could not wait to talk to journalists on 1 December,during which he vigorously expressed his attitude. 
However,to prove that Taiwan was not abandoned by the United States,the Taiwan authorities brooked no delay to declare that the United States had already agreed to help the Taiwan military keep up the Hsuanchi Program and develop advanced early warning planes and other electronic warfare systems.
In order to seek absolute security and exercise world hegemony,the new administration has right from the start been impatient in proposing changes to the Clinton Administration 's NMD program. 
Second, Bushism stresses maintaining a military super power status,seeks and worships the state 's absolute security.  A case in point is Bush 's rushed decision on the deployment of the NMD following his coming to power by brushing aside opposition from China and Russia.
As soon as Bush took power,he announced that the United States would continue to develop and deploy the National Missile Defense [ NMD ] system. He has also advocated expanding the coverage of the system by protecting US allies as well as the United States itself. 
Ignoring powerful pressure from world opinion,the new Bush administration wasted no time in testing its national missile defense system and has begun devoting even more funding and energies to space. 
It is only three weeks since Bush 's inauguration on 20 January,but President George W.Bush himself and his cabinet members have been unable to hold themselves back and have talked a lot about the national missile defense system(NMD),thus showing their firm determination to deploy the NMD.
No sooner Bush had come to power,he rushed to announce the continued research and deployment of the NMD system and called for expanding the coverage scope of the NMD system which would not only protect US territories but also those of US allies. 
In particular,after entering the 1990s,influenced by the right-wing thinking,Japan impatiently adopted a series of measures to break out of the prohibition of the constitution of peace it was forced to implement after losing the war. Its defense spending is ranked second in the world and its military technology and many other areas have caught up or even surpassed the United States.
Recently,it has hurriedly changed its national military strategy. 
Why did Li Hongzhi act so impatiently that he had to jump out himself? 
She can not wait until she has formally wielded power on the island to leap out with her typical insolence and arrogance and make an exceeding dangerous provocation against the compatriots in Taiwan,the people of all of China,as well as the international community. 
Observers point out that the most direct and evident information gleaned from the fact that,only three months after taking office,the Bush Administration could not wait to deploy an NMD program far exceeding that of his predecessor is that the United States needs to simulate its economy,which has started a downturn,by means of stepping up production in the defense industry,and also to offer a political reward to the military industrial complex for supporting Bush in getting into the White House. 
The Taiwan authorities have hurriedly stepped forward to help Lee Teng-hui,claiming that Lee was the former head of state.  They also said that whether Lee can go to Japan or not is an issue that involves the entire country and that the Taiwan authorities have the obligation to help him go.
The mainstays of the heretical Falungong organization have for the most part all moved to the United States.Just a small number are currently in the middle of going through the formalities. They were unable to leave because Li Hongzhi impatiently exposed his wild political ambitions too soon.
After her return to Australia,she was unable to control herself any longer and started talking a lot of nonsense. 
his rushing to play his trump card - - Tenet - - had another more important purpose - - to maintain the US monopolizing position in the Middle East peace process to prevent other powers from having their hands in the affairs in the Middle East region. 
Defense Agency Director Could Not Wait  
It has been reported that less than three months after assuming power,Chen Shui-bian took $ 250 million with him and hastily went to six Central American and African countries to give out money and play the role of a money dispenser. 
Bush not being able to wait for the announcement of the result of the formal recount of votes,and his rush to prepare for the transition made the Americans feel he was not acting like a gentleman and lacked the leader 's quality of being a broadminded.
Recently, Taiwan independence element Annette Lu [ Lu Xiulian ] stepped forward impatiently and brazenly promoted her nonsense of the so-called two Chinese countries on both sides of the Taiwan Strait in a futile attempt to split Taiwan from China.
Recently, Taiwan independence element Annette Lu [ Lu Xiulian ] stepped forward impatiently and brazenly promoted her nonsense of the so-called two Chinese countries on both sides of the Taiwan Strait in a futile attempt to split Taiwan from China.
Whenever cross-strait relations are advancing forward and the compatriots on both sides are expecting an early reunification of the country,and are exerting themselves for this purpose,Annette Lu invariably jumps out in haste and puts on a clumsy performance. She counted the records but forgot the ancestors,disavowing that she is a Chinese,professing your China and our Taiwan,  you Chinese and we Taiwanese.
Precisely at a time when affairs on the island are in a big mess,the leader of the Taiwan authorities can not wait to run off before the tattered stall has been packed up ; this naturally dumbfounds the people on the island,and also further exposes his true features in deliberately extending the Lee Teng-hui line in creating two Chinas and one China,one Taiwan on the international scene.
The spokesman pointed out : Annette Lu,who picked up a few crumbs in the recent election of leaders in the Taiwan region,has rushed out to sell her Taiwan independence stuff,thus revealing her true colors of being fierce and tough before she takes office.
Bush was seen casually placing his hand on his chest with his fingers opening up. What was more embarrassing,when the national anthem of the host country was being played after the US national anthem ended,Mr.Bush was seen quickly putting his hand down as if thinking nothing of the host country. 
After gracing the graves of her ancestors with her certificate of election as the running mate of the DDP candidate who,with sheer luck,had won in the activities for the change in leadership in Taiwan in March with less than 40 percent of the vote,Annette Lu started to feel left out after her initial bout of over-excitement before she had even officially assumed office. She can hold herself in check no more. 
Just as his predecessor,whenever he can smell something from the activities of the international anti-China forces,the leader of Taiwan authorities brooks no delay in joining in the chorus. Generally,he does his utmost to exaggerate military threats from the mainland confronting Taiwan.

Mennonite vs.Tzu Chi  
Combining medicine with evangelism has always been one of the Mennonite Hospital 's aims. 
At present only five hospitals are providing daytime nursing care on an experimental basis : the Cardinal Tien Center in Hsintien,the Monroe Hospital in Hualien,the Puli Christian Hospital,the Chiayi Christian Hospital and the Provincial Fengyuan Hospital. 
In 1953 the Mennonite Hospital opened a nursing school which recruited over 200 local Hualien people-mostly aboriginal girls-to train,free of charge,as nurses. 
When we come to the Mennonite Christian Hospital in early December,a huge Christmas tree stands in the middle of the foyer of the newly completed hospital building.At the registration counter,in the consulting rooms,at the payment counter,at the pharmacy and even in the staff offices,everywhere is festooned with colored streamers,snowflakes and fairy lights.Instead of the cold,depressing atmosphere usually associated with hospitals,the place is full of the warm and festive spirit of Christmas. 
In Hualien County,everyone has heard of the hospital set up almost entirely by foreigners-the Mennonite Christian Hospital.Over the past few years,thanks to several public fundraising campaigns,its name has gradually become familiar to people outside Hualien too. 
In 1961,the Mennonite Hospital set up milk stations in many villages,and the more than 10,000 children who passed these milk stations on their way to school each morning could all get a glass of milk to supplement their diets.
Fifty years ago,they started out as a mobile medical team,then opened a clinic in a rented former aluminum foundry ; later,they built a 35-bed hospital.Today,the Mennonite Christian Hospital is a regional teaching hospital with 300 acute care beds,200 long-stay beds and over 600 medical staff. 
And as the health care system moves towards competition and commercial-style management,how will it uphold its beliefs and principles? 
Ten years ago,a brand new 1000-bed teaching hospital-the Tzu Chi Buddhist General Hospital-was built in Hualien County.The 30-year-old,three-story Mennonite Hospital building,with its leaking roof and moldy walls,appeared decrepit and cramped by comparison. 
Because of Taiwan 's growing prosperity,financial assistance to the Mennonite Hospital from the Mennonite Church in the US has continuously been reduced. 
Acts of sacrifice and giving are part of everyday life at the Mennonite Hospital,not anything out of the ordinary. 
The hospital 's principles sometimes bring it into conflict with the world around it.In some cases these conflicts have been insuperable,and over time they have grown more acute.One such clash led it to close down its nursing school. 
If the surroundings at the Mennonite Hospital have a religious flavor,its people are even more of a religious bent. 
Today,as Taiwan 's health care resources are growing ever more abundant,how will the Mennonite Hospital change? 
For any consultation or treatment,up to and including surgery,the charge was NT $ 1.Luo Chi-mei of the hospital 's development office explains that the reason for making this symbolic one-dollar charge,rather than simply providing free treatment,was to foster an attitude of not wasting limited medical resources. 
Some people note that religious medical centers,not only Logefil but also including the Changhua Christian Hospital,the Luotung Catholic St.Mary 's Hospital,and so on,are all facing a transformative challenge. 
Mennonite medical missionaries have been in Taiwan for half a century-since 1948,when the Mountain Area Evangelism Committee of the Presbyterian Church in Taiwan invited the General Conference Mennonite Church in the US to organize a medical team to come and do relief work among Taiwan 's aboriginals. 
In the first eight years of its existence,the hospital adopted a dollar a patient policy.
And once the foreign missionaries began to grow old and return home,yet with most local Taiwanese doctors unwilling to go to out-of-the-way Hualien,patients also gradually began to turn away from the hospital,with its aging facilities and obviously stretched personnel. 
As well as assuring a high standard of health care to patients,the Mennonite Christian Hospital in Hualien provides a pleasant and inspiring work environment for medical and administrative staff. 
For five decades the Mennonite Hospital has grown with Taiwan,while giving it the most practical help. 
Long-serving nurse Hsu Jen-hsiu recalls how at that time,because of the state of the Mennonite Hospital 's facilities,many people deserted it in favor of the Tzu Chi Hospital,even some medical staff. Ambulances would take patients to the Tzu Chi without even asking, she says.
Psychological counseling and occupational therapy are also important functions of the hospital. 
Five years later,the Joint Commission on Rural Reconstruction made a significant contribution to building a 35-bed facility at the present location of the hospital. 
From humble beginnings,the hospital has grown into a reputable and prestigious institution.

We do not simply teach students specialized knowledge.Even more,we hope that we can awaken the student 's sense of ' consciousness.' This statement by Tien Po-yuan expresses the ideals of Master Hsiao Yun,and can be seen as a summation of the spirit of the current wave of Buddhist education.
In Taiwan,the wave has struck even harder and made even a bigger splash. 
In Taiwan,the wave has struck even harder and made even a bigger splash. 
In ten years there has been at least NT $ 30 billion in investment poured into this trend, estimates Hsu Wen-sheng.
The reason why the reshuffling of the intelligence and security heads was so indicative was that it has significance in three respects. First,simultaneous changes of the secretary general of the National Security Council [ NSC ] and chief of the National Security Bureau [ NSB ] not only signified the completion of the second stage of personnel consolidation of the national security establishment,but also indicated that the intelligence and security heads consolidated by Chen Shui-bian have formally taken position. 
He used an analogy to say that in this reshuffle actors did not change but only puppets changed, implying that Chang Chun-hsiung should have stepped down in this reshuffle.
What 's more,banks have discovered that the trade surplus has continued to grow.There was US $ 2.5 billion in the first quarter of this year alone - - but most of it was not remitted to Taiwan.When one adds that capital outflow was as high as US $ 1.1 billion for the quarter,it is obvious that this wave of mainland fever is bringing capital across the strait at several times the previous rate. 
In fact,it is not only private sector enter-prises that look with fear on employee resignations.Even government institutions have felt the impact of employee turnover. 
The view of the Taiwan public opinion is that this bout of mainland fever represents people 's longing for the normalization of cross-Straits relations,and the message brought back by those who had visited the mainland,namely,that the mainland is exercising flexibility in promoting talks under the one-China principle,has become an issue that Taiwan 's new authorities must face and can not evade.
As to Tsai Chao-ming,the first civilian head of the NSB,he has attracted the greatest attention during this wave of changes of the intelligence and security heads.

It was at this time that Tsai Chih-chung again took up his pen,creating the four-frame comic strips The Drunkard and The Bald Detective. Ao You-hsiang,Hsiao Yen-chung,Cheng Wen,and Chu Teh-yung all entered the ranks of animators in this wave,and all left their mark.
According to the military 's internal analysis,this wave of military news curbs is because of media reports last month on the Control Yuan 's investigation on Vice Chief of General Staff Wang Han-ning who rented out his family quarters,and a string of reports unfavorable to the military 's internal unity,and leadership and command.
Even DPP members think that the new authorities have become troubled and confused in this bout of mainland fever.
The wave of KMT personnel changes has attracted considerable attention because Huang Kun-hui and Huang Cheng-hsiung,two elder statesmen in the Lee faction,are returning to the network of party affairs and party-run operations,and Lien-faction member Tu Te-chi is leaving the Central for other party-run operations. 
It 's true that traditional Chinese paintings,led by Chang Dai-ch'ien and P'u Hsin-yu,have fetched record prices at international auctions in New York and Hong Kong recently,a source of some pride to Chinese people everywhere.So why are the darlings of the new art investment craze on Taiwan not traditional Chinese paintings like theirs but the works of elder Taiwan artists who have no name recognition on the international market and are deemed imitative of late Western Impressionism?
After the lifting of martial law in the 1980s,many different forces in Taiwan 's society began to energetically exert themselves.Among these were a number of aboriginal movements,seeking to uncover their true spirit. Those young indigenous people who signed up for journalistic education to some extent have all been affected by his new wave of social activism.
No resources for factories : From nothing to something,then back again to nothing ; how could the Chinese in Vietnam get back on the crest of the wave when the tide of economic liberalization finally arrived? 
Nevertheless,the high-level decision-making leadership still has made arrangements for Tsai Chao-ming,who has been one of the key persons fostered by the authorities,to take over the NSB.As the first step,Han,whose relations with Ting Yu-chou were strained,was promoted to deputy secretary general of the NSC,then,Tsai Chao-ming was transferred back as the emissary to the United States,and,in the current personnel changes,promoted to head of the NSB. 
For geologists and paleontologists,these finds are cause for celebration,and for Chinese generally,who have for millennia described themselves as descended from dragons and who have deep feelings of attachment to them even if they do n't know why,these fossils have provided food for thought in idle moments around the dinner table.The burning question : Is there any connection between the dragons their ancestors worshipped and the extinct reptiles the dinosaurs?

The budding wave of Taiwan studies which began after the late 1970 ' s has still not - - in the eyes of Soviet scholars themselves - - produced any major results. 
Stamp fever across the Taiwan Strait : The fever for investing in stamps,brought about by the switch from the depressed stock and property markets,also has its foreign investment, creating a mutually reinforcing effect.
But it does n't matter if there is fever on the stamp market,or whether there is chaos ; for purist stamp collectors,these create no significant losses except for some slight disturbances.

He was more afraid that his foreign backers would wipe him out at one blow just as they did toward the Order of People 's Temple and the Branch Davidian Cult .

In addition,the judgment was as good as a great sarcasm of people who had returned to the inland after the government 's persuasion : So those who respected justice and abided by the law would suffer,while those who were willing to drag out their stay and take advantage of legal loopholes would gain instead ; so the gist of the Hong Kong law is to encourage people to not abide by the law.

The top-secret Chien-an Zone on Chih-hang Air Base in T'aitung is located in the hill by the runway of the base. Like Chia-shan Base in Hualien,it was built with the approval of former President Chiang Ching-kuo while Hao Po-ts'un was the chief of general staff. The construction,beginning in the eighties and completed in the early nineties,cost more than NT $ 10 billion.
Most women give birth at home with the help of a midwife,and if complications arise,they must be taken to Taitung. 
The wing commander pointed out : The main purpose of the underground tunnels in T'aitung and Hualien bases is to preserve combat strength.

Today the economic development in the Chinese Mainland 's coastal regions is so fast that many Taiwan and foreign businessmen are flooding into the Mainland markets. Amid this torrent,the only opportunity still available for Taiwan is that Taiwan must make the best use of the situation. 
Meanwhile,the Taiwan media has depicted another scene : mainland investment fever,  Shanghai inspection fever,  high-tech enterprises moving west fever have swept across Taiwan like waves following one another.
To strive for international support and to increase their political stakes for resisting the motherland 's mainland,the Taiwan authorities have launched their diplomatic offensive again and again. They spare no expense and play all kinds of tricks in this regard.

Painters like ChenCheng-po,Li Mei-shu,Yang San-lang,Li Shih-chiao,and Liao Chi-chun depicted subtropical Taiwan in drawings from life.You could say this was Taiwan 's first fine arts movement. 
A few months later,on May 12,the opening exhibition of the Heirloom Art Center,managed by Pai Hsing-san,director of the Consumer 's Foundation,once again featured the superhot works of senior painters Li Shih-ch'iao,Yang San-lang,Hung Jui-lin et al. 
As a child,he acquired from two friends of his father an interest in painting. 
If you want to understand the full force of the surge you should consider some figures first.The going rate for an oil painting by Yang San-lang,the most famous of the older painters,was NT $ 18,000 per hao(one hao is about the size of a postcard)four years ago,NT $ 20,000 three years ago and NT $ 26,000 two years ago,when the market reaction was still so-so. 
In both content and form,Ho 's and Liu 's work differed radically from that of their contemporaries.Unlike Ho and Liu,who lived and died abroad,the remainder of the older generation of painters,such as Liu 's contemporary Chen Cheng-po and Ho 's contemporaries Yang San-lang,Li Mei-shu,and Li Shih-chiao,all spent their lives in Taiwan. 
Li Shih-ch'iao,Li Mei-shu,Yang San-lang and their peers were the target of fierce attacks by young artists back then! 
And the price of his paintings had been cranked up,as originally planned,to NT $ 36,000 per hao as soon as the show was over. 
Yet after a one-man retrospective exhibition of his was held last November at the Taipei Fine Arts Museum,in cooperation with the Asian Arts Center and the East,Hsiung Shih and Impressions art galleries,who put out word that prices are going up,so you 'd better buy now, nearly 200 of his paintings were sold at the galleries over the next two or three months - - not only was it a complete sellout,but potential buyers were being turned away empty-handed.
As master painter Yang San-lang has pointed out,nothing quite bears looking at as well as the brick walls of an old house set off against the multitudinous hues of green that spread out year-round from branches all over the island 's south. 
When facing a beautiful landscape my whole heart is filled with rich colors.I 'm compelled and uplifted.I get unlimited inspiration from the land.
He established a name for himself in Taiwan by mailing works home to participate in the Taiwan Fine Arts Exhibit sponsored by the Japanese colonial government.In three consecutive annual shows he received highest honors. 
One collector points out that before the auction the price of a small painting by Yang San-lang was NT $ 100,000 ; after the auction this was immediately adjusted to NT $ 150,000.What is strange is that this rise in prices has not been limited to this one-off frenzied shopping spree. 
After ten years abroad,Yang San-lang returned to Taiwan in 1933.With a collection of several hundred works,and his precocious show merits,Yang easily drew a warm welcome in Taipei,and the forgiveness of his family. 
At sixteen he resolutely left home to study abroad.Under the rigorous training of the Japan Art Institute,his hard work met with success. 
Thus,Yang San-lang,together with six prominent peers,founded the Tay Yang Fine Arts Association. 
(In those days)artists were not received by society...Unless you had a supportive family,it was nearly impossible to pursue painting .Born into a scholarly and well-to-do family,Yang San Lang initially encountered resistance when he expressed his desire to paint.
During the Japanese occupation period,Taiwanese works were high in quality and in volume.Many of the songs of great Taiwanese artists of those days are still popular and are often sung today.In the 1960 ' s and 1970 ' s,Taiwanese music nearly disappeared from the airwaves,but it did not die without a trace. 
At that time the country was devoid of a fine arts culture. 
Yang San-lang 's perseverance is visible in his effort to overcome a physical handicap.One of his fingers rendered useless in a childhood accident,the artist copes by binding two of the fingers of his right hand together when he paints.He explains his dedication to his art saying My generation handled people,affairs and studies with an attitude of diligence and respect.
Li Tze-fan??passed away last year and the price of his paintings more than doubled overnight.Judging from examples like that,a continued boom in prices is surely possible.
While many landscape painters use photographs,Yang San-lang insists on the superior experience of painting out of doors. Nature is my greatest teacher he says reverently.
Those who know him best,however,insist that his realistic portrayals spring from a natural genius. 
Yang San-lang 's interest in art sprouted under adverse conditions.He explains Its not like today.
In his youth,Yang studied in Japan and France,where he immersed himself in museum masterpieces,aesthetic scenery and the society of renowned artists. 
In Taiwan his favorite sites are the beaches of Yeh liu and a mountain near Miauli There I find the greatest variety of color ,he notes.
Ten years ago Kuo Po-ch'uan 's paintings were n't worth anything,and who would have dared to buy them then?If you come to me you will have to explain where the painting came from,and I plan to set up a screening committee of experts to authenticate paintings. 
A cornerstone of the early art world in Taiwan and an accomplished and prolific painter,Yang San-lang seriously underestimates his own influence. 
His wife remarks, His personality is such that once he says he 'll do something,nothing can stop him.On rainy days he paints figures and stilllifes in the house.but when there is a typhoon he goes to the beach to paint waves!
Of his own work he says I am only satisfied with one or two.
Yang San Lang 's early fame and leadership abilities gave form to the nascent fine arts movement in Taiwan nearly sixty years ago. 
Jose Marti was a well-known Cuban poet,writer,national hero,and pioneer of the Cuban Revolution of Independence.

The unchecked spread of pirated publications has seriously dampened scientists,artists,writers,and various other copyright holders ' enthusiasm for innovation and hindered the enhancement and advancement of the nation 's quality as a whole.

Many years ago,Baglioni composed a song named My love is as deep as the ocean and instantly became a popular hit throughout Italy and made Baglioni widely known as a popular song composer.
Of course,the correct stance is very important for a writer or an artist in embodying contradictions. 
Young writers must certainly enhance their sense of urgency,mission and responsibility,carry out artistic creation in the midst of the people 's historical achievements,advance art in the midst of the people 's progress,and bravely shoulder the important historical task entrusted to them by the Party and the people. 
Many Chinese writers,scholars,and movie stars who once visited the US,students studying in the United States,and Chinese people who once visited their relatives in the United States,have also actively written articles and books about the United States. 
However,the unchecked spread of pirated publications have seriously hurt the enthusiasm of innovation of scientists,artists,and authors and owners of various copyrights,thereby generally hampering the improvement of national quality. 
we must persist in respecting literary and artistic patterns and the creative work of artists and writers,propagating artistic democracy,and promoting free competition among various literary styles and equal exchange among different views to make the literary landscape even more glorious. 
The military 's literature and art have a huge and consistent influence on society. This is directly related to the fact that the military has groups after groups of writers and artists who are quite popular and that new writers and artists are springing up. 
It is widely known that,in both wartime and the peaceful period of construction,our military 's writers and artists have from beginning to end considered themselves the Party 's literary and artistic fighters. They have always been brave in plunging themselves into the life of fiery struggles and created their works with great enthusiasm. They have played a very important role in inspiring and encouraging the military 's morale and in improving troops ' fighting power. 
This requires our military 's writers and artists to pay close attention to reality,go deep into all aspects of society in a positive way,beat with the pulse of the times and have acute senses and deep insight. 
The reputation of this heroic unit has been spread around the nation ever since. In his famous work Who Is the Most Lovable Person, writer Wei Wei eulogized this heroic unit.

Indian writer Singh wrote in Outlook that the people of India are totally disenchanted with politics and their political leaders because of corruption,and that explains the vote in favor of Mother Teresa who had nothing to do with any politician.
If our military 's writers and artists can achieve these,they can obtain the rich source material contained in various new and typical aspects of society,reflect the real spirit of the times accurately and in a lively manner,and create highly concise,perfect and successful works with clear characteristics of the times. 
Military writers and artists must hold a serious and meticulous attitude towards their creations. If we choose the right topic,make resolute efforts,refine our works repeatedly,and try to make every piece a masterpiece,we should be able to put out what is superior through persistent efforts. 
From his acknowledgment during talks with the late Japanese right-wing writer Shiba Ryotaro that, up to 22 years of age,I was a Japanese, we can clearly see that Lee Teng-hui is genuine scum of the Chinese nation.

A reporter asked whether the mainland is pinning its hopes on the people of Taiwan and whether it has given up hope on the Taiwan authorities. 
Guo Zhenyuan pointed out : The Taiwan authorities hope to maintain the situation of long-term separation between the two sides of the strait. On this point,they share the same interest with the United States.Therefore the Taiwan authorities put their hopes on the United States,but this is wishful thinking. 
The conviction in socialism is not an empty slogan nor a spiritual sustenance. 
On the other,the mainland is booming,with Beijing 's successful bid to host the Olympic Games and China 's imminent WTO accession,providing a vast market and business opportunities for Taiwan and the world. Therefore,Taiwan compatriots certainly pin their hopes on the win-win situation and common prosperity of the two sides of the Strait through seeking reunification. 
In accordance with the custom created by the rulers ' propaganda,the relatives of the military men also regarded the tablets placed here as entrusted by their souls and had to go and pray there every memorial day.

Entrusted to pursue socialism by communists of several generations,this great move has turned socialist theory into reality. Our party has established a basic line which will remain unchanged for 100 years. That is,one central task - - taking economic construction as the central task ;

Some people lead a life devoid of meaning and believe in false science. They look for spiritual sustenance in various superstitious activities. Some people only care about themselves. 
They say the current generation of Chinese,young people in particular,is a lost generation.  That is why Falungong and other cults take advantage of this and become popular,showing the Chinese are seeking a support to fill the spiritual emptiness.
The reason was that there are progressive ideas and progressive things going on here in China.World progress to a large extent depends on China.China is my home.
In the end,instead of curing their diseases, Falungong has harmed these people. Besides,traditional ideology has lost the original ability to control and adjust society,leading to blankness in the belief of some people. Thereupon,they also want to have something to repose their trust in.

And they are not confident about the cause of constructing socialism with Chinese characteristics. They have no ideas anymore and are low in spirits. 
A number of issues are evident from this report. 
We can discern many problems by looking at Taiwan 's geographical setting. Taiwan is a typical mountainous island. It has a total of 88 islands of all sizes,with a total area of 36,000 square kilometers. 
It is thus clear from the above mentioned facts that the anti-China forces in the United States have never stopped their activities aimed at meddling in the Taiwan question and interfering in our country 's internal affairs. 
We can see from this that using spatial data and visualization methods to provide battlefield mapping support has now gone far beyond traditional mapping support methods. 
Adams,director of Human Rights Watch 's Asia division,said : This interpretation clearly shows Beijing 's attempt to stifle Hong Kong people 's open discussion for more democracy. It is obvious that Beijing authorities are not interested in what Hong Kong people think or hope for.

Particularly,the United States time and again broke its promises to China made in the 17 August communique and continued to sell advanced weapons and military equipment to Taiwan.As a result,Sino-US relations went through turbulent periods of ups and downs without mutual trust. This point is very clear if we take a look at the tension in Sino-US relations caused by Lee Teng-hui 's [ Li Denghui ] visit to the United States. 
As long as we view the history of our country over the past 50 years,we may clearly see the superiority of the socialist system and find the general trend of our nation 's development from weak to strong and from poor to rich. 
It is evident from the entire process of their refusal to allow Xie Changting to visit Xiamen to their refusal to allow Zhu Yayan to visit Kaohsiung that the Taiwan authorities have consistently adopted an attitude of delaying and blocking cross-strait exchanges.

Subsequent search led to the seizure of about 300 tablets of suspected ecstasy,84 grams of suspected ketamine and two beef-knives in a room of the disco. 
In a subsequent search,a bullet head was located in a shop in Ho Pui Street opposite to the disco. 
During a raid on the disco conducted by Police officers attached to Crime Headquarters of Sha Tin District and Police Tactical Unit at 1.45 am this morning(October 20),another six men and a woman aged 18 to 31 were arrested for trafficking in dangerous drugs with 35 tablets of ecstasy seized. 
At about 1.30 am today,officers from Narcotics Bureau,Anti-Triad Squad and Special Duty Squad of Wan Chai District,and Police Tactical Unit of Hong Kong Island raided a disco on Gloucester Road,resulting in the arrest of two men and a woman. 
It is believed that the ecstasy tablets seized are used to provide to discos and other entertainment centres in the Yau Tsim Mong District.Customs investigations are continuing, said a spokesman for the Customs and Excise Department today(March 8).
A 33-year-old woman wanted in connection with a criminal damage case in Tsuen Wan was also arrested in the disco.

For this reason,we must stress that the issue of Taiwan can not be postponed indefinitely because indefinite rejection of negotiations will only lead to war. 
For this reason,we must stress that the issue of Taiwan can not be postponed indefinitely because indefinite rejection of negotiations will only lead to war. 
Evdokia and her husband Vladimir defected on April 3rd,1954,making a big international headline and leading to Australia 's announcement of the severing of diplomatic ties with the former Soviet Union. 
Up to now,not only has the Kosovo issue yet to be settled but new humanitarian catastrophes have been brought on,making the situation in the Balkan region tenser and tenser. 
Recently,there has been an uproar in Taiwan on this issue,which has become a political struggle between the political parties,masses,and Taiwan authorities. 
However,because his understanding of the laws of socialist construction was insufficient,because of theoretical errors,because of incorrect response to dramatic changes in the international situation,he also committed subjectivist errors,which resulted in the failure of the great leap forward and the people 's communes,and,particularly,this finally led to the great political chaos of the cultural revolution that was immensely harmful to the cause of socialism in China.
The Chernobyl nuclear accident occurred as a result of the hidden safety trouble in the reactor,as well as serious violation of the safety regulations. 
After careful investigation,an expert group of the US Marine Corps studying the accidents finally found out the cause. It turned out that the US military had ignored a dangerous critical state in the flight of the Osprey - - the state of collar vortex,which resulted in the crash of the aircraft and the death of the crew. 
In 1999,the US-led NATO disregarded the norm of International Law and bypassed the UNSC and frenziedly bombed a sovereign state-the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia for as long as 78 days,causing the biggest humanitarian disaster in Europe since the World War II,killed more than 2,000 innocent civilians,and wounded more than 6,000 people. Some one-million people lost their homes and more than two-million people lost their sources of income. The direct economic losses reached $ 600-billion yuan. 
Even though the emperors were overthrown,the thoughts of emperors remained in some people 's minds and may float back again when there is an opportunity,causing new tragedies. 
The violent culture and environment in the United States bring on the frequent gunshots on campus. 
As is known to the people throughout the world,the Kosovo War has plunged Yugoslavia,a sovereign state,into an abyss of misery and covered it with wounds and scars. It is the most serious disaster Europe has suffered since World War II,and also the gravest humanitarian catastrophe the world has witnessed since the Gulf War. 
According to the initial report made by the investigation team,there were no dubious factors for the explosion. But the military unit obviously violated the operational rules while transporting outdated explosive articles scheduled to be scrapped. A mistake led to a military vehicle colliding with a bus,causing heavy casualties. 
However,as things changed later,and Mao Zedong also greatly changed his own ideas. He violated the principle of seeking truth from facts and linking theory with practice as he constantly advocated,exaggerated the seriousness of class struggle,and eventually led to a major disaster of the Cultural Revolution, which caused serious losses to the country and the people and caused an unprecedented setback in the Sinicization of Marxism.
In March of last year,US-led NATO,disregarding international law standards,putting up the slogan of evading a humanitarian disaster, openly circumvented the United Nations Security Council,and carried out 78 days of fierce bombing of the sovereign nation of Yugoslavia,in effect brewing the largest human rights crisis in Europe since World War II.
It has been eight days since the warplanes of the United States and Communist China collided. Although the positions of the two sides have become a little closer,people of these two countries are exerting ever-growing pressure on their leaders to uphold their own positions. Opportunity for finding a solution will apparently be fleeting while at the same time a stalemate is taking shape with each passing day. People all over the world are deeply concerned about whether a crisis will occur in US-China relations. 
The one-vote veto for comprehensive management of public security should be firmly exercised on anyone who fails to work hard,conceals actual situation,and causes major public security problem and serious consequences ; and in this case,the relevant leaders should also be sternly dealt with and held liable. 
And precisely because of this,the coalition must be formed in a certain way,finally yielding something which can only be new harm to the overall fundamental interests of the people of Taiwan. 
Finance is the heart of modern economy and undermining the country 's financial order is comparable to stabbing the heart with a dagger. If the wound is minor,the bank alone will suffer some financial loss ; and if the wound is deep,the case can trigger an economic crisis and the people will suffer.
Still some others report only what is good while concealing what is unpleasant and cover up contradictions and problems,resulting in evil consequences. 
For those who are incompetent or who hide the situation,resulting in serious social order problems and grave consequences,the one-ballot veto system for comprehensive management of social order must be enforced. The leaders concerned should undertake the responsibility and be sternly punished. 
some have reported good news only but not bad news,and covered contradictions and problems that lead to bad consequences. 
The persons causing accidents because of playing favoritism and committing irregularities,perverting justice for a bribe,and bartering power for money should be severely punished according to law without any leniency. 
Those who caused the incident because of their corrupt behaviors such as playing favoritism and committing irregularities,accepting bribes for letting someone break the law,and trading power for money must be seriously handled in accordance with law. 
Secondly,the incident points to a question : It caused a lot of trouble to resolve the matter of warplane collision even though mechanisms for military exchange and dialogue exist between the United States and Chinese Communists.It is hard to imagine what the outcome will be if a similar incident occurs between the two sides of the Taiwan strait,which have no mutual-trust and dialogue mechanisms. Can it be resolved as smoothly as the recent incident between the United States and Chinese Communists? 
In 1995 when Lee Teng-hui was still in office,it was relatively calm and there were no major events across the strait and between China and the United States.However,he bought a plane ticket on his own to visit the United States,creating a serious cross-strait crisis and a vile impact. Today,he has already retired for one year. 
While the regiment 's intention to cut wear and tear of weaponry is understandable,not using the new weaponry made the regiment pay in terms of its defeat in the exercise. The lesson learned from that form of even greater wear and tear is thought provoking.
Nearby holiday resorts are to be moved to some other places to ensure that the military base is still a well-concealed place. The aircraft collision happened probably because the Americans were too anxious to fathom the mystery of the military base. 
For examples,in 1975 it supported Cuban mercenaries to get involved in the civil war in Angola.From 1977 to 1978,it was involved in the military conflicts between Ethiopia and Somali.In 1978,it intervened in the factional struggles within Afghanistan. 
Of course,all these are not the main trends.
The judges agreed that Lin 's creative approach was straightforward and unpretentious.
Hsu Li-kung,a movie producer who has known Lin for 10 years,describes Lin and his wife as film festival migratory birds.
Lin Chen-sheng,the leading man of God Bless America,who has also just finished directing his first film,believes that screenwriting and directing are two distinctly different skills,and while a director should understand how scripts are written,he need n't write them himself. 
Short and pot-bellied with stubble on his chin,Lin Cheng-sheng has an earthy appearance.He is the first choice of many directors to play the role of a Taiwanese farmer. 
From baking,to acting,to directing,has Lin had more opportunities? 
With little support from private indus-try over the past few years Taiwan film makers have fallen on hard times.There are no signs that things are improving.With government grants providing the largest source of financial support,only 24 films were made here last year.Two of these were by the new director Lin Cheng-sheng. 
When Lin graduated from junior high school,his father insisted that he study at a vocational school to make it easier to find a job,whereas Lin thought he would only find happiness in life if he attended an academic high school and went on from there to college. 
Besides letting the camera speak,Lin was also hard at work writing. 
In 1993,among the activities connected to the ROC 's Year of Films included a contest for best short dramatic film.Lin received a grant to shoot a family drama : The Family Jewels.
In Lin Cheng-sheng 's two films the nature of the relationships between the female characters is rather ambiguous,so that some people even think that Murmur of Youth is a lesbian movie. 
Lin Cheng-sheng - - A Baker 's Life in Film  
Critic Huang Chien-ye agrees that Lin uses the camera in that film much as Hou does in his films,but points out that the film includes various spiritual and mystical elements,such as the appearance of the deceased mother 's spirit,which are entirely absent from Hou 's work.Furthermore,it is much colder and more removed in its handling of emotions. 
Ang Lee,Tsai Ming-liang and the new directors Chen Yu-hsun and Lin Cheng-sheng all direct from their own screenplays.Is this a new trend? 
As a child,Lin Cheng-sheng would frequently awaken to the arguments of his father and grandfather. Life is very dramatic,and my father was destined to have a similar sort of relationship with his own son. Bitterness between the generations over thwarted ambitions ended up characterizing the relationship between Lin and his father too.
The visiting teacher asked the class for the meaning behind the film,and his classmates offered up a lot of film theory.The teacher did n't think it was that complicated,and Lin raised his hand and answered, He 's looking for love.
Huang Chien-ye believes that Lin has come out with films three years running because he has worked hard looking for opportunities.Still, the film industry is in such dire straits here that you ca n't earn a living through them.It 's dreaming to think you can.
His grandfather,who was active in the resistance to Japanese rule,was wanted by the authorities and had fled to Yenan,where the communists were based in the mainland.When Lin 's grandfather left,Lin 's grandmother was already pregnant,and when he finally returned from the mainland he discovered that he had a ten-year-old son. 
Deciding to film the process of turning the apples to alcohol,they used the left over money to buy a simple camera.Lin,forever the inquisitive boy, thus started fooling around with making documentaries.
I was just playing myself,sharing my own appearances with the audience, he says,describing himself as a poor actor whose body just moves back and forth. True actors have got to do a lot of homework. If he were really to make a career out of acting,he feels that his performances should be making people who know him exclaim, How is Lin Cheng-sheng acting like that!
Lin,whose hands had much experience of digging the soil,could get to the heart of the subject matter.They shot 70 reels,or 140 hours,and eventually it was cut down to a two-hour film. 
Murmur of Youth is an expression of my feelings about my mother and my realizations about married life, Lin says.As for A Drifting Life,he explains, I would n't say that I shot a lesbian movie,for it really just touched upon the beginnings of love between two people of the same sex ; it 's really more about youth.
They were both 29.After getting married,Lin Cheng-sheng concentrated on writing screenplays,and the two would occasionally help out as hands on a farm friends ran up in the hills.On the Chingching Farm the couple had a big workers ' shed to themselves,and Lin would joke that it was like they were taking their honeymoon again. 
Little Yeh agrees with Lin 's way of putting things.He holds that the main reason so many films are being written and directed by the same person is that too few movies are being produced,and that you ca n't make a living anymore just by doing one job or the other. 
One day,in front of his rented home in Hsintien,Lin climbed an osmanthus tree to pick a bloom,and when he looked below at Ko,who was just about to return to Kaohsiung,he suddenly felt a strange and indescribable attraction for her.Perhaps the fragrance of the blooms put a spell on him.The two went from classmates to sweethearts to husband and wife. 
Lin neither came up through the ranks in the movie industry nor studied film in school.His off-the-beaten-path career has been described in some media reports as legendary. Lin grew up in southeastern Taiwan,in Taitung County 's Kuanshan.
The curtain went down for the 22nd Hong Kong International Film Festival(HKIFF)following tonight 's(Saturday)screening of the closing film Sweet Degeneration by Taiwanese director,Lin Cheng-sheng who has established himself as a key figure in the second wave of the new Taiwan cinema.
Lin enrolled for the third term in which the screenwriting and directing class was offered.Ko Shu-ching had enrolled for the second term,but they became classmates when they both took the advanced class.Lin Cheng-sheng and Ko Shu-ching came together thanks to a osmanthus tree. 
They left their number with a member of the film 's crew,but soon thereafter they were surprised to read in the paper that filming had already started. We felt very bad because we loved Hou Hsiao-hsien 's movies, Lin recalls. But all we could do was tell ourselves that we were n't fated to work on that picture.
The leading lady of God Bless America is the singer Chiang Shu-na,and the leading man is Lin Cheng-sheng,who played a gangster in the movie Tropical Fish.For several days there have n't been any scenes in which they appear.Ah Tsung,a scrawny boy who has a big part,is here though. 
After class,Lin used to hang out with Ko and her buddies.

Hong Kong has benefited greatly from its strategic position at the heart of the fastest growing region in the world,an Asia that is increasingly more open to global trade and investments. 
China and the ROK have similar culture and are close neighbors. The development of relations between China and the ROK has the advantages of favorable climatic,geographical and human conditions. 
Our society is free,fair and stable. We have no debt. We have significant reserves and a sound banking system. Our strategic location and extensive experience on the Mainland are quite simply unmatched by anyone.

His high-sounding reason for this was that the US economy is now growing too slowly,and a tax cut will help to stimulate economic growth. 
It is now hard to predict whether India will become a strategic ally of the United States or China,but India 's attractiveness will sooner or later change the balance of power of these three countries in the region. 
Repayment of loans also increased sharply by 20.5% in July but at a slower rate than loan growth. 
The speed with which our military realizes the two fundamental transformations depends on the performance of every commander and soldier in these great changes.
Nevertheless,the pace of decline in orders-on-hand for the manufacturing industry as a whole was slower in December 1997 than in the preceding two months.

The US military believes that doctrinal research and technical development are two aspects of the same matter. If either aspect is behind a step,it will be difficult to increase unit battle readiness. 
The main reason some places are sluggish in action and are making slow progress is that their leading comrades do not understand the need for reform. Some of them adopt a wait-and-see attitude and are afraid of difficulties. 
I deeply understand this point through my studies and research. But in terms of reforms to her political and legal systems,China 's progress is still very small and very slow. On this point,my five months of living in detention gave me an understanding I had not previously had. 
The localities experiencing a slowdown in export growth or a negative export growth must try to find out where they fall short,press forward in the face of difficulties,try hard to catch up,and strive to achieve goods results in export work. 
successfully intercepting a short-range missile at an altitude of 80 km is like a slow ball in baseball,whereas a true interception should be like 10 national-grade curve balls! 
When talking about this,Zhou Yongkang said : When facing the unprecedented great development in the world 's economy and technology and the intense international competition,we deeply understand that an area may be left behind and become backward if no development is made or even development is not made fast enough. 
Deputy Zhao Zhihao said only if the economy develops fast and well can we have a good future and enjoy high international status,and,if we are slow in development,we will be left behind and beaten. 
Although Jilin 's foundation for development is a little bit better than the western provinces,yet its heavy mental burdens,slow market growth,and particularly many of its deep-rooted contradictions that have restricted economic development have not been fundamentally resolved. 
Hence,early understanding and rapid adjustment will place us in an active position,while late understanding and slow adjustment will throw us into passivity. 
in addition two Patriots had to be launched to intercept one Scud ,each costing $ 530,000 ; the Scud is extremely inaccurate,about equivalent to a 1,000 kg bomb,its speed is also slow and it is very easy to detect ; when interception takes place,fragments from both missiles fall on one 's own side.
Accounting for the six per cent failed pledges,the Chief Secretary for Administration said the reasons were varied. They include difficulties in locating premises for different purposes,longer time than expected to draft and process legislation and delays due to construction works,etc. 
Big ships could only turn around slowly,and would incur losses when they switch over to the market economy. As a result,the overall performance of Liaoning 's state-owned economic sector slipped. 
The earlier we understand the economic structure problem and make structural readjustment,the earlier we will have the initiative in our hands. If we are late in knowing the problem and slow in solving it,we will land ourselves in a passive position. 
Party committees at all levels must uphold a strong sense of being responsible for the party 's cause and the military 's construction,think of the future,make long-term plans,devote prolonged effort,and be responsible to generations to come even if they themselves are only in the position for one term. Party committees at all levels must devote meticulous,long lasting,and permanent effort to building up the foundation and to daily implementation so as to realize overall improvement through overall consolidation and pursue comprehensive implementation through comprehensive progress. 
At present,more than a few people have held that the more trump cards the better,with new equipment being released in large quantities to the troops as soon as possible.
universality versus individuality ; wish versus possibility ; and self-motivation versus compliance to objective laws so as to make reasonable general planning and scientifically guide the training project for the maximum possible improvement in efficiency and gains.

B : So far as our country is concerned,it wo n't do if we do n't develop ; it wo n't do if our development is slow. Today,the trend toward economic globalization has intensified ;

He held that the government should make proper preparations before dealing with any major issues. The two sides [ of the Taiwan Strait ] should hold negotiations first before any laws are amended.  The practice of carrying out the regulations on an experimental basis on off-shore islands is worrisome.

The practice of carrying out the regulations on an experimental basis on off-shore islands is worrisome.
Taiwan has a main island and numerous surrounding islets. It requires 400,000 troops to guard some 80 islets. With scattering targets of defense and arduous and overlapped defense missions,once a major battle operation is staged,Taiwan will surely face the situation of attending to one thing and losing sight of another or having too many problems to tackle all at once. 
In no way can the people of the offshore islands accept the reconsideration proposal,and if the proposal is passed,the people of all walks of life in Penghu will protest further, stressed Su K'un-hsiung [ Su Kunxiong ],speaker of the Penghu County Council.
According to the statement,the Statute of Off-Shore Island Development stipulates that direct air and shipping services be operated with the mainland on a trial basis by Quemoy,Matsu,and Penghu before the opening of full-scale direct transportation services between the Taiwan proper and the mainland. This is what the local people have been longing for over the years as well as the only opportunity for developing the economy of these off-shore islands. 
While strongly criticizing the disregard of reality by the Vincent Siew Cabinet, officials and people on the off-shore islands are prepared for a full-scale protest.
Farther away,on the outlying island of Penghu,county magistrate Lai Feng-wei said : Beijing 's victory in its Olympic bid makes it possible for the Chinese to wipe out the disgrace of being called sick men of East Asia.
As revealed by a public-opinion poll conducted by Taiwan 's LIENHO PAO [ United Daily News ],61 percent of the people approved of the trial-implementation of the small-scale three links by the off-shore islands,while only 19 percent opposed it. This shows that the reconsideration proposal is an act against the people 's will.

Taiwan 's Executive Yuan is going to file a reconsideration proposal for the small-scale three links clause in the Statute for Off-Shore Island Development,which has just been adopted by the Legislative Yuan. This has triggered a momentous wave of reaction from both the ruling and opposition party caucuses in the Legislative Yuan. In particular,officials and people in Penghu,Quemoy [ Jinmen ],and Matsu,filled with strong indignation,are prepared to go to Taibei [ Taipei ] to protest.

In his opinion,the small-scale three links will invigorate industry and commerce,lead to prosperity,and bring about a thriving scene,thus enlivening the off-shore islands.
In his instruction,Vincent Siew said : The consultations between the ruling and opposition parties were held too hastily regarding Article 18 of the Regulations Concerning the Construction on Off-Shore Islands regarding the small-scale three links.  The regulations will split Taiwan into two parts. Although the regulations are to be carried out on off-shore islands first,they will exert impacts on Taiwan proper.

Li Chu-feng [ Li Zhufeng ],a New Party legislator from Quemoy scathingly condemned Vincent Siew for going back on his word after failing the election. This legislator said that in the near future he would mobilize natives on the off-shore islands to go to the Executive Yuan for an egg-pelting movement.

Penghu County Magistrate Lai Feng-wei [ Lai Fengwei ] said the small-scale three links will bring hopes to the people of Penghu marked by longtime economic backwardness. Now that Vincent Siew wants this to be reconsidered, he continued,many people have shouted abuse,saying that this is to tease the people of the off-shore islands.
the stock market in Taiwan plummeted again and again. All this has seriously hindered Taiwan 's economic development. Recently,the Taiwan authorities and the relevant departments decided to legalize small-volume trade,which has existed for many years,between the masses on both sides as of 1 January 2001 and to lift restrictions on the direct exchanges of cargoes and personnel between Kinmen,Matsu,and other islets off Taiwan and the coastal area of Fujian on the mainland side.

Guangzhou Military Region also concentrated on the missions of a theater of operations,and created a series of military theories,combat methods,and training methods characteristic of a theater of operations,and put these to the test in military exercises. This was effective in promoting improvements in units overall combat power. 
The Guangzhou Military Region has adopted strict measures to correct once and for all the formalism practiced by some units during scientific and technological military training. It has issued the following clear and definite instructions : All reform achievements concerning operations must be repeatedly tested in a realistic battlefield environment with actual troops,actual equipment and live ammunition ; to ensure truthfulness,stability and reliability of an achievement,the commanders and technicians who take part in testing it should be charged with clear and definite responsibility ;  
In guiding the scientific and technological military training of troop units,the Guangzhou Military Region has closely integrated learning new knowledge with studying and mastering new equipment,new skills and new tactics,incorporated them into specific technical and tactical subjects,and turn them into applied training courses which combine knowledge with skill. In this way,it has had feasible training methods and appraisal criteria and made battlefield application of high-tech knowledge a required course which must be tested. 
The changes in the appraisal criterion on the drill ground indicate that the efforts made by the Guangzhou Military Region to constantly rectify the guiding principle of scientific and technological military training for troop units have been yielding good results. 
The Guangzhou Military Region,which is located on the forefront of reform and opening up,has always been carrying out ideological and political work with emphasis on studying and solving new situation and problems under the conditions of reform,opening up and the development of a socialist market economy,on studying and solving main,difficult,hot and doubtful problems faced by various units at present,and on summing up and promoting effective experiences in army building in the new period with good results. 
To build an unbreakable transportation route under high-tech war conditions,they conducted bold explorations by giving play to the advantages of combined services in accordance with the plans of the headquarters and the experimental task which Guangzhou Military Region had entrusted to them. 
As early as in 1986,a regiment of the Lanzhou Military Region that was advanced in carrying out reform and opening up silently tried to advance the principle of material interests in ideological and political work. 
The Shenyang,Lanzhou,Jinan and Guangzhou Military Regions have started an educational activity of seriously implementing the ' three represents ' and thoroughly realizing the ' five words ' among the troops and have put forward some concrete procedures and measures for it.
Nanjing and Guangzhou Military Regions,the PLA Navy and Air Force,the Second Artillery and other troops capitalized on the new motivation provided by the conference spirit to oppose pro-Taiwan independence splittist forces,and to intensify preparations for military struggles.
In its initial stage,the scientific and technological military training was relying on several sensible persons to train several top soldiers and produce several high-quality products . Now,it has leaped to applying scientific and technological knowledge in enhancing the troop units ' overall combat effectiveness. Both the work concept and the motivational means of the scientific and technological military training in the Guangzhou Military Region are changing.
The Nanjing and Guangzhou Military Regions are carrying out in-depth studies on sea crossing and landing operations and probing various kinds of new operation methods. They have held several real-personnel exercises,which have enhanced their capability for actual combat. 
The gunsmoke in several military exercises has rectified the objectives and standards of scientific and technological military training of the Guangzhou Military Region,and it has also smashed formalism and bubble achievements in training.
Guangzhou Military Area Command devoted firm and resolute effort to formulating fighting strength and logistic supply abilities on the basis of military units as a whole. This measure focused on the crucial point in the current construction of fighting strength throughout the military. It is of great significance for preparing for military struggles according to higher standards and quality criteria. 
The party committees of the Nanjing and Guangzhou MR 's decided to organize a major demonstration of and competition in military skills by first-rate trained soldiers before the end of this year to exchange training experience and promote the development of science - and technology-based military training in depth and breadth. 
This was a great honor : In 1964,the first company of a certain command of the Guangzhou Military Region,as representatives of the Tashan heroic troops ,participated in an all-army contest. The officers and men crawled and rolled in combat and fought bravely. They won praises from party and state leaders with their outstanding performance to record a glorious chapter in the company 's history.
On the afternoon of 19 February,Jiang Zemin conducted inspections in Gaozhou,as soon as he arrived,in the company of Zeng Qinghong,alternate member of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee,member of the Secretariat of the CPC Central Committee,and director of the Central Organizational Department ; Li Changchun,member of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee and secretary of the Guangdong Provincial CPC Committee ; Lu Ruihua,deputy secretary of the Guangdong Provincial CPC Committee and governor of the Guandong Provincial Government ;  
Deputy Zhang Miansheng,an instructor of a certain unit of Guangzhou Military Region,fully agreed with what deputy Zhu Wenquan said : Whether it is military exercises,or the fight against flood in 1998,they expressed the interests of the state and people ; ours is an invincible iron army that dares to fight tough battles,is skilled in ferocious fighting,and fears no bloodshed or sacrifice.
Jiang Zemin and Zeng Qinghong,alternate member of the Political Bureau,member of the Secretariat,and head of the Organization Department of the CPC Central Committee who was following Jiang Zemin on the trip,went to inspect the work in Shenzhen,Shunde and Guangzhou,accompanied by Li Changchun,member of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee and secretary of the Guangdong Provincial CPC Committee ; Lu Ruihua,governor of Guangdong ; and Liu Shutian,political commissar of the Guangzhou Military Region. 
The Nanjing and Guangzhou Military Regions,the Navy,the Air Force and the Second Artillery Corps persistently apply the winning in war standard in evaluating their work of building grass-roots units,and they are carrying out a comprehensive army building to ensure winning in war .
Since this summer,a military transportation unit of a certain combined service sub-section of Guangzhou Military Region has succeeded in organizing a joint tri-service operation to carry out the sea-land transportation. 
Gao Siren,director of the Liaison Office of the Central People 's Government in SAR ; Yang Wenchang,commissioner of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of China in SAR ; Lieut.Gen.Ou Jingu,vice commander of PLA Guangzhou Military Area Command ; Maj.Gen.Wang Jitang,commander of the PLA HK Garrison ; Maj.Gen.Liu Liangkai,political commissar of the PLA HK Garrison also attended the reception party. 
In S &amp; T training for troops,the Guangzhou Military Region emphasizes transformation of the results of the training. Through the spread of training achievements,the achievements are transformed into overall unit combat power. 
Guangzhou Military Region is using test beds as the vanguard to lead its advance. It is using its focus on difficult points and attacking key problems to promote all-around progress. It is gradually making S &amp; T training for troops standardized and scientific,and it has seen clear improvements in the quality of unit military training and in the level of combat power of its units. 
Dang Xiangun,a fighter from the 1st Company of a certain regiment,was not a top soldier picked beforehand for the scientific and technological military training contest of the Guangzhou Military Region in August this year. However,on the day of the contest,he was chosen by lot at the last moment,but he ended up in winning the first place in the fighters ' military theory contest of the Military Region. 
Taking a good look at the drill ground of the Guangzhou Military Region for scientific and technological military training,we have found two different tracks of training reform left on it successively. The past one was setting a training course first,and then tackling problems,followed by submitting achievements for award. 
Guangzhou Military Region guided its officers and soldiers in adopting a concept of scientific training based on the demands of actual combat as the impetus,talented people as the foundation,S &amp; T as the guide,the masses as the main body,and standardized execution of training. The Military Region proposed that S &amp; T training for troops must have scientific instruction,scientific training,and scientific management. 
On this foundation,the Guangzhou military area artillery group continues to deepen the trial. They expanded the rapid reaction system to a digital system that is command motor agile,correspondent network convenient,message current,reconnoiter measure diversity,which brings about the entirely digital automation from reconnoiter goal,message handle and assistant determination to the whole process of shooting.
Accompanied by Commander Tao Bojun of the Guangzhou Military Region,Chi Haotian arrived at the Shenzhen Base of the PLA Hong Kong Garrison on the morning of 19 February.He extended his warm greetings to officers and soldiers there. Chi Haotian highly praised the results achieved by the unit over the past two years and more since it stationed in Hong Kong. 
The surprise attack group determined on taking the beach finally took its position on the beach. The above was a scene of a joint combat training exercise held by the missile company of a certain antiaircraft artillery regiment of the Guangzhou Military Region,which showed that a certain new-type missile deployed in the company has turned combat effective. 
Some units made special efforts to deal with cadres occupying too many houses or wining and dining at public expense. The Guangzhou MR party committee explicitly stipulated that no Chinese and Western liquors are allowed during public functions within the military region ; that no one is allowed to accompany inspection teams in their inspection tours,travel long distance to welcome people or send them off,exceed the reception protocol,or accept valuable gifts. 
APEC is located around the Pacific Ocean region,and its members are distributed throughout America,Asia and Oceania. 
The RIMPAC exercise series is a routine,maritime joint military exercise held by the United States and its Pacific rim allies once every two years.
RIMPAC ' 96 and ' 98 both had conflicts in the Asia-Pacific region as their background. 
That the United States has staged more joint military exercises with its Pacific rim allies is nothing but the natural outcome of the implementation of such a non-base presence strategy.
The US forces have claimed that the purpose of staging the recent RIMPAC 2000 exercise is to make the navies of the countries involved in the exercise more capable of maintaining stability in the Pacific rim region.
The United States announced that this was the first time they had added a humanitarian rescue operation to the combined circum-Pacific war drills.
In his address at the opening ceremony,Chilean President Lagos pointed out : The Pacific Ocean plays an important role in bringing together countries in the Asia-Pacific region and in the development of their civilizations. I hope that countries on the Pacific rim will further step up economic and trade and cultural exchange to cope with the challenges in the new century,and boost economic and social development of countries in this region. 
US newspapers and journals also admitted that this is one of the links in the strategic deployment planned by the United States to shift the focus of its global strategy to Asia and direct the spearhead at China. 
World Applauds Chinese Vessel CaptainsOn 6 July 1998,the US Navy 's Pacific fleet and their allied navies in the Pacific region jointly held a Pan-Pacific exercise in the waters of the Hawaiian Islands.
A Japanese reporter said in the Tokyo Shimbun that the circum-Pacific military exercise in which the United States plays a leading role was designed to enhance the technological level of naval vessels in a decisive battle,but its nature has changed a great deal . The recent military exercises are a part of the ' non-war military operations ' strategy drawn up by the US Army .
These people not only can remember history,they can also find a better way to remember history : China 's Su Man,Japan 's Tamaki Matsuoka,the United States ' Fisher. 
The recent large-scale RIMPAC 2000 exercise has taken place in the Central Pacific Ocean where the US Force Pacific Command is located,and this has made it easier for the US forces to command or muster its allied forces in the Pacific rim region and is thus of extraordinary significance.
In the past,the ties between Europe and America,on opposite shores of the Atlantic Ocean,have always been close. But the ties between Pacific-rim East Asia and North America have been strengthened because of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation Forum.The ASEM has built a bridge between the two large continents of Asia and Europe. 
In fact,the economy in the contemporary world has shaped into a pattern of East Asia,West Europe,and North America coexisting like three legs of a tripod,of which America and Europe across the Atlantic Ocean have all along maintained a relatively close association,and the relations between East Asia and North America surrounding the Pacific Ocean have been strengthened thanks to the establishment of the Organization of Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation. 
Apart from the United States,six other countries also took part in this year 's exercise,including Britain,Australia,Canada,Chile,Japan,and the Republic of Korea [ ROK ],namely,nearly all the major allies of the United States in the Pacific rim region have taken part in this year 's exercise.
The United States also tries to keep its allies under control. Take the circum-Pacific exercise,for example. During the exercises in the past,it was the US Army which took lead in waging a decisive war with another marine power.

During the combined circum-Pacific military exercises staged in June and July,the United States took the lead in conducting a one-week humanitarian rescue operation code-named Strong Angel .

In the past,most nursery companies in Taiwan acted mainly as agents,either being commissioned to gather seeds for overseas firms or handling seed and seedling imports.But a growing labor shortage and rising wages mean Taiwan can no longer compete with Southeast Asia and mainland China. 
Do you still remember how ten years ago,when a group of young people had just started out in the information industry producing computers and peripherals for foreign OEM buyers,many big businessmen sneered : What kind of high technology is this?
Most of our export clothing is inexpensive,so that even though export quantities are high,profits are not as great.Moreover,it is becoming difficult to survive with competition from other developing countries. 
Analyzing the development of cross-strait relations in two phases,he said : While Taiwan went through the phase of working for the United States,taking the mainland market as the dominant factor will be the next phase. Taiwan should go beyond the past practice and strategy. 
Thus,even if Taiwan industries keep shouting for creating one 's own brand name, and a lot of Japanese businessmen such as Kiyoshi Nishimoto think that there is no other way when trying to open up the Japanese market,Taiwan businesses ca n't avoid the fate of making goods under a Japanese brand name.
It was decided that the company was to be publicly run,and its main job to undertake production for VLSI design companies. 
In the past,labor was cheap and diligent,and the ROC could create an economic miracle by earning a profit from manufacturing for others. 
Many famous brands have set up factories in Taiwan or sub-contracted work to Taiwan enterprises. 
In the Japanese market we still only do work on contract for other companies,but we ca n't get jobs with the better names and so are forced to work as an OEM(original equipment manufacturer)for second-tier Japanese companies(such as Noritsu and Morita), Kao Shun-cheng painfully explains. Some of the techniques in these second-tier companies are inferior to our own.Who knows whether or not they 'll dispense with us once they get our know-how?
Even more deftly,turning around the OEM road,it has delegated an American company to produce for it. 
However,this is not exactly in line with what people understand.Taiwan 's exports are mostly manufactured on behalf of others.Even if everyone was willing to invest all their effort starting now,it seems the gap is too large. 
What one sees even more often are the expressions of dissatisfaction when a shop 's maintenance man opens a box to find that the cord has not been wound up well.Especially since Sampo is currently only in Japan as a contracted manufacturer making machines for other companies ' brands,it is of course even more important that they have to be very careful.
We want to move from being OEM(original equipment manufacturer)to ODM(original design manufacturer). 
The first is to learn new methods and skills by working in cooperation with foreign manufacturers.The second,called Original Equipment Manufacture(OEM),involves producing a product for a foreign company according to specific instructions,using that company 's trademark. 
Yet as of last year,the information industry had already left many of Taiwan 's former number-one industries far behind,becoming our nation 's third largest export industry. 
If the Made in Taiwan image is not good,it 's not completely because the quality is not good, says Stan Shih,chairman of the Brand International Promotion Association(BIPA).The quality of products is uneven,from cheap vendors ' products to high-class name brands.But most top products are made under someone else 's name,or,even if they have their own label,they do n't stress their pedigree.
Among the leading exporters in Taiwan last year,34 reached this level,but only four did it with finished products under their own labels. 
In recent years,the animated film industry in the ROC has suffered a lack of creativity.Famous as a source of contract work for foreign cartoon projects,there have been relatively few ' Chinese ' style cartoons produced in the studios of local production companies.Due to the efforts of a few concerned individuals however,this will soon change. 
Where industrial design differs sharply from art is in its need to consider the consumer 's needs and compete successfully in the marketplace.Generally speaking,most countries already possessing a high level of technology and productivity but lacking the means to invent new products turn to improved product design to upgrade their goods and enlarge their market share. 
After these steps have been completed,one can begin to speak of setting up integrated operations. Only then can Taiwan reach its main goal of producing its own products under its own label to compete in the international market.
Companies doing OEM can also pick up management concepts and market information,more reasons why some established companies keep a large amount of OEM work. 
Supervising instructor,Ch'en Mingteh,also stresses the importance of exercise.Each day during the lunch period he leads his students in some fierce ping-pong matches.The pottery class trains the students to develop their talents and to continually strive for excellence. 
Wang shared Hu 's enthusiasm for the project and he felt that the domestic cartoon industry had to shed its image as an assembly house for foreign cartoon companies. 
Wang Chung-yuan and King Hu have invested a great deal in the belief that a Chinese cartoon industry can find creative acceptance both at home and abroad.( 
Wang 's Cuckoo 's Nest Production Inc.,employing 400 workers,has often cooperated with the American cartoon company,Hanna Barbera. 
The company had as early as 1974 begun producing suits for export sale. 
Ricebowls must be compact,easy to hold attractive,and not burn the hands that hold them.Ricebowls that meet these basic needs sell well ; those that do n't stay on the store shelf.Put simply,industrial design aims to make products more attractive and easy to use,requiring a minimum of human effort. 
For example,ricebowls,selected by UNESCO as one of the thirty essential articles in daily life,appear to be extremely nondescript in appearance.

But,training in ordinary times is by no means so easy and satisfactory. 
The ancient painting restoration team,led by Marta Castillejo,has tested the laser restoration technique on an artificially aged painting containing a variety of organic and inorganic paints. The results are satisfactory.
However,Li Hongzhi has time and again plotted and instigated people obsessed with Falungong to upgrade themselves or attain the so called final fulfillment by committing suicide,staging a hunger strike,and so on.
Therefore,the most appropriate way is to bypass this thorny issue and hand this hot potato to his successor. Only thus will he be able to put a satisfactory full stop to his final term in office.
Responding to the pressing needs of the preparations for military struggle in the new period,the purpose of science and technology training the troops will raise as soon as possible the combat strength of the troops,allowing the troops to fulfill gradually their future operational tasks.

He said,with the joint efforts of the entire deputies,the third session of the Ninth NPC deliberated and approved all reports and adopted corresponding resolutions,adopted the Legislation Law,and thus successfully fulfilled all tasks. 
What should you do in order to get rid of sin , become awakened ,and reach perfection ?
The Falun Dafa concocted by Li Hongzhi encourages practitioners to reach for the high hierarchy,  increase their energy potency,  attain completion, and eradicate karma.  His real aim is to exert effective mental control on practitioners.
With the joint efforts of the deputies,the eleven-day long 3rd session of 9th NPC has reviewed,approved all reports and has passed relevant resolutions and Legislation Law and has successfully accomplished all tasks. 
In early 1999,Dong Ning,aged 26,a Falungong practitioner in Weihai City Changhong Electromechanical Company Limited,Shangdong Province,thought his practice of Falun Dafa was complete and began to formulate a plan of relieving other people and himself.
If you take another half step forward,you may very likely fall into the pond of ultimate consummation.
And today,with his ascending to heaven and consummation, Li Hongzhi has inveigled Falungong addicts and even women and children to destroy their lives by the extreme means of self-immolation.
Since the end of 1998,the Ministry of Water Resources and the Huang He Water Resources Committee have gathered experts to conduct a study on major problems of the Huang He and countermeasures.  They have drawn on achievements of the programs to harness the Huang He and scientific research and adopted the latest hydrological data to strive to determine a complete set of latest data on the Huang He 's water conditions.
By means of modern media including the Internet,they intensify their efforts to spread the heretical fallacy of Falun Dafa and instigate the cult 's followers to pass the test and to accomplish religious training .
Over the past year or more,Li Hongzhi has published more than 10 so-called scriptures, whose contents are in the final analysis intended to bring spiritual pressure to bear on people obsessed with Falungong through a so-called upgrade or fulfillment, thus securing spiritual control over or instigating those people to defy the law.
In less than six months,3,928 enterprises were closed down and 2,956 enterprises were transferred to the state and local governments. So,the task of completely disengaging army and police units from business has satisfactorily been realized. 
Using this tenet,Li Hongzhi has deceived people into wholeheartedly learning,practicing,and safeguarding his Falun Dafa in the hope that they can thus meet the requirements of the great principle ,be uplifted to the super level , reach perfection ,and return to the universe.
if you die,either you were possessed or you have merely passed to a higher level to practice Falungong more perfectly. 
It is essentially about taking the quest for fulfillment as its aim and the worship of the founding father as its means of spiritual control to convert practitioners and make them turn over a new leaf and start life anew in order to achieve his ulterior anti-humanity,anti-science,anti-social and anti-government political objectives.
Just when the millions of families were happily celebrating the Spring Festival heralding the Year of the Snake,a number of Falungong addicts,bemused by Li Hongzhi 's heresy on ascend to heaven for consummation, committed a shocking self-immolation incident in Tiananmen Square.
However,the present U.S.action to increase its forces in the Gulf area,even if no real war results,will enhance its military presence in that area. It will save to some extent the face of the United States and put a satisfactory period to Clinton 's presidential career. 
Attaining fulfillment is a front,leading people to ruin is the inevitable result.
This shows that Li Hongzhi 's real intention is to bring pressure to bear upon the party and government under the pretext of upholding Buddhist doctrine and to do everything in his power to undermine social stability under the pretext of achieving consummation.  It is as simple as this ;
Explaining his motive for killing,Dong Ning said that at that time there was only one thought on his mind,which was that someone was asking him to take people away - - relatives,friends,anyone would do ; if he could take away one person,his practice would be complete and he would be able to relieve people.
Today,looking through Falungong 's flaunted upholding human rights,  truthfulness,compassion,forbearance,  consummation, and so on,we can also encapsulate this in one word : murderous.
Li Hongzhi 's so-called genuineness,kindheartedness,and forbearance are falsehood. He incited the practitioners to disregard life and death,  act at the end of forbearance,  go for complete satisfaction, sacrifice their own and their families ' precious lives for him and for overseas anti-Chinese forces.
Some of met their death through self-mutilation,through hanging,through jumping into a river,or through disembowelment. Hiding under the wings of the western anti-China forces,Li Hongzhi,to seek reward from his masters and to show he still has some worth,has lately constantly boasted about the last fulfillment and issued the Last Straw sutra on the first day of the new century with the aim of encouraging his fanatic followers to give up all for truth.
In the absence of a mechanism of peace guarantees,the process of relaxation of tension on the Korean peninsula will not last long. Thus,replacing the mechanism of truce with the mechanism of peace guarantees has become an urgent task. As far as the north-south relationship is concerned,it is unavoidable for both sides to touch and be involved in issues of various aspects such as issues of ideology,systems of the state,security guarantees,and economic interests during the turning period. 
Otherwise,they might become possessed and be unable to train themselves in the way of Falungong,and can not be perfect. Having been fooled by the twisted logic and cult expressions of Li Hongzhi and the Falungong,many followers of the Falungong practice it with great devotion ; but no matter what they do,they are still just ordinary people and have not managed to move to any higher level or achieve perfection.
